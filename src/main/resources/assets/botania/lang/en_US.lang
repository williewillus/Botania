# - BASIC
# -- WELCOME TO BOTANIA
botania.entry.welcome=Welcome To Botania
botania.tagline.welcome=Welcome to the Hotel Botania
botania.page.welcome0=&oWelcome to Botania! I congratulate you on the fine choice of strapping a sapling and a book together, or just finding this tome in a chest. Whichever applies.<br>&oYou can navigate this book using the arrows at the bottom of this page, your mouse wheel or the arrow keys in your keyboard.
botania.page.welcome1=&oDespite its looks, Botania is in essence a "tech mod", by definition of requiring you to put to use ingenuity, thought and redstone to create and progress. It's good to keep that in mind.<br>&oOf course you'll also be rewarded with cool toys, blocks and equipment, if you're worried.
botania.page.welcome2=&oFor all intents and purposes, Botania is a mod that anybody who likes to play the game with the primary purpose of building cool things will likely enjoy. It is designed to be fully playable standalone, but is also playable with other mods.<br>&oExcluding a small few examples, everything in the mod is fully automatable using minecraft and its own features exclusively.
botania.page.welcome3=&oIf you happen to find yourself lost, try checking out the mod's Achievements or Challenges, both of which can be found on the left hand side of this book's main page.<br>&oThe book is laid out in a friendly way with a good amount of handy features, so before you start jumping in and playing, take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with what the various tidbits around the place do.
botania.page.welcome4=&oAfter this you'll be taken to a page where you can optionally start a tutorial that will teach you the basics of the mod in around ten minutes, give or take.<br>&oHowever, it teaches you only the very basics. So, after you got a good foothold on those concepts, further research is a good idea. 
botania.page.welcome5=&oIf you're unsure as to what you want to learn about, hold SHIFT while browsing through the various categories to get a quick idea of what each thing is.<br>&oThe "Lexicon Index" category can be very helpful for searching, as it contains every entry in the book in one place.
botania.page.welcome6=&oAnd that's it for this introduction! You can move on to the tutorial now. I hope you enjoy playing with Botania as much as I enjoyed making it!<br>&o~Vazkii, the mod author<br><br>&oCarry on by pressing the "Back" button on the bottom. Your right mouse button or backspace key will have the same effect.

# -- TUTORIAL OF THE BASICS
botania.entry.tutorial=A Tutorial of the Basics
botania.tagline.tutorial=Get set up quickly
botania.page.tutorial0=While one could just go through the various entries in the book at their leisure, there's also a tutorial of sorts available. Clicking the buttons below will guide you through the basic concepts of Botania.<br>You can pick between an ingame guided tour of this book, or a short(-ish) video.

# -- GARDEN OF GLASS
botania.entry.gardenOfGlass=Garden of Glass
botania.tagline.gardenOfGlass=Your new challenge
botania.page.gardenOfGlass0=In the &2Garden of Glass&0 nobody can hear you scream.<br>You're alone in space.<br>How exciting.
botania.page.gardenOfGlass1=The &2Garden of Glass&0 is a skyblock mode for Botania. It's advised only for players who are somewhat experienced in the mod, but if you're new to it, you're more than welcome to try it out anyway.<br>Most of the mod functions the same, but some tweaks have been put in place to allow for the skyblock style game. They'll be listed in the following pages. 
botania.page.gardenOfGlass2=After spawning in the &1Garden of Glass&0 you'll find &1Living Roots&0 below the landing area. These can be used to create &1Saplings&0 and &1Floral Fertilizer&0. They also work as &1Bone Meal&0. Shift-right clicking a &1Dirt&0 or &1Grass&0 block with an empty hand will have you rummage through the soil, finding some &1Pebbles&0, that can be converted into &1Cobblestone&0. Filling a &1Petal Apothecary&0 can be done with a &1Bowl&0 by clicking on a water block.
botania.page.gardenOfGlass3=Creating &1Saplings&0
botania.page.gardenOfGlass4=Creating &1Floral Fertilizer&0
botania.page.gardenOfGlass5=Creating &1Cobblestone&0
botania.page.gardenOfGlass6=Aside from that, some things in Botania are different to fit the Skyblock play: The &1Orechid&0 is easier to make, faster and much cheaper; The &1Cocoon of Caprice&0 and the &1Mana Spreader&0 have different recipes; the &1Blaze Lamp&0, which can be used to create &1Obsidian&0, uses powder instead of rods; melon or pumpkin seeds may drop from tall grass; floral fertilizer creates more per craft, and &1Sugar Canes&0 and &1Slimeballs&0 can be crafted.
botania.page.gardenOfGlass7=Creating &1Sugar Canes&0
botania.page.gardenOfGlass8=Creating &1Slimeballs&0
botania.page.gardenOfGlass9=A problem that one might face in this world is entering the &4Nether&0. Worry not, however, as &1Blaze Lamps&0, as mentioned previously, can create &1Obsidian&0. To get these lamps, creating &1Blazes&0 using &1Fel Pumpkins&0 might be a good investment.<br>Since there's no easily available &1Flint&0, opening the portal with a &1Fire Charge&0 will have to do.
botania.page.gardenOfGlass11=Aside from providing light, the &1Mana Flash&0 present in the starting area allows a player who has lost their &1Lexica Botania&0 to exchange a &1Sapling&0 for it, by right clicking with the &1Sapling&0 on the &1Mana Flame&0.<br>This can only be done if the player doesn't have a &1Lexica Botania&0 on them.
botania.page.gardenOfGlass12=Lastly, an &1End Portal&0 recipe

# -- LEXICA BOTANIA
botania.entry.lexicon=Lexica Botania
botania.tagline.lexicon=What you're reading right now, dummy
botania.page.lexicon0=The &1Lexica Botania&0 is the repository of all knowledge for all botany related matters. But you probably knew that already.<br>All information is stored here, as expected. For convenience, if a block happens to have an entry, it can be shift-right clicked with the &1Lexica Botania&0 to open that entry.
botania.page.lexicon3=Any entries typed in &oItalics&r are &4basic&0 entries, which contain the very basic knowledge required to play Botania. They should be prioritized over others, most of the sections contain one or more, so a good look through through them is a good idea.
botania.page.lexicon1=Crafting the &1Lexica Botania&0.
botania.page.lexicon2=The &1Lexica Botania&0's title can also be customized. By placing it in an &1Anvil&0 and renaming it, one can not only change its cover, but also the title.<br>The Edition of the lexica shown equates to the version of the &4Botania&0 you're running, and no, I don't care about the fourth wall.

# -- MYSTICAL FLOWERS
botania.entry.flowers=Mystical Flowers
botania.tagline.flowers=The roots of your studies
botania.page.flowers0=Around the world, you may stumble upon a large variety of Mystical Flora. Spotting these doesn't take much work as the flowers themselves emit a fair amount of shine.<br>They come in a total of &416 &0different colors.<br>It's also possible to grow these flowers using &1Floral Fertilizer&0 (read on).
botania.page.flowers1=Flowers as far as the eye can see...
botania.page.flowers2=These flowers can be plucked for &1Mystical Petals&0, that can be used for making magical instruments and plants alike.<br>Right clicking a petal on the ground will &4bury it&0, having it emit particles.<br>These petals can also be crushed into &1Floral Powder&0, which functions much alike any mundane piece of dye.
botania.page.flowers3=Plucking Petals off Flowers.
botania.page.flowers4=Crafting the &1Pestle and Mortar&0.
botania.page.flowers5=Grinding Petals into Powder.
botania.page.flowers5.5=Grinding mundane flowers into Powder.
botania.page.flowers6=Right clicking the &1Floral Powder&0 in any &1Wool&0 or &1Carpet&0 changes its color to the color of the powder.<br>By mixing the &1Floral Powder&0 with some &1Bone Meal&0, it's possible to create a different type of fertilizer. The &1Floral Fertilizer&0 will grow a small amount of &1Mystical Flowers&0 in the nearby vicinity, if you ever run low on them.
botania.page.flowers7=Making fertilizer (any powder colors work)
botania.page.flowers8=Using typical flower substances also works
botania.page.flowers10=There's also some taller variants of the typical &1Mystical Flowers&0, spread around the place. These can only be gathered with &1Shears&0, but can be used to obtain twice the amount of petals a normal flower would yield. They're a bit too big for dye, though.
botania.page.flowers12=Tall flower variants can be made manually by fertilizing a &1Mystical Flower&0 or a &1Buried Petal&0 with &1Bone Meal&0.<br>If you find yourself running low on a particular color, try burying a petal of that color and using &1Bone Meal&0 on it.
botania.page.flowers11=Prepare for trouble
botania.page.flowers9=Petals can also be made into blocks

# -- PETAL APOTHECARY
botania.entry.apothecary=Petal Apothecary
botania.tagline.apothecary=What you use to make flowers
botania.page.apothecary0=In order for a botanist to create plantlife that can do its bidding, one would need special means of infusing plants with mystical energy.<br>Luckily, the &1Petal Apothecary&0 does just that.
botania.page.apothecary1=The &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.apothecary2=This block, when placed in the world and given some water (by use of a &1Water Bucket&0), will accept any &1Mystical Petals&0 thrown at it, releasing their energies.<br>Once one has set the correct petals in, throwing some &1Seeds&0 in will finalize the proccess.<br>Tossing in the full bucket will also fill the recipient with water.
botania.page.apothecary3=Quite a few plants can be made using this method, for more information, read on the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Generation Flora&0 sections of this Lexicon.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Petal Apothecary&0 with an empty hand will remove the last item thrown in.
botania.page.apothecary4=Instead of &1Water&0, one can place &1Lava&0 in this block, if that is done, it'll serve as a brazier and incinerator, destroying any items that come in contact.<br>Furthermore, tossing in &1Vines&0 also gives the block an overgrown visual.
botania.page.apothecary7=&1Comparators&0 can detect whether the block has water or not.<br>Since the &1Petal Apothecary&0 can be filled by usage of a dropped &1Water Bucket&0, and &1Dispensers&0 can fill buckets, creating a system that can automatically refill the water in the dish shouldn't prove too difficult.
botania.page.apothecary6=A simple tip for those who want to squeeze the biggest efficiency out of every block is as follows, up to twenty seconds after crafting a flower in this block, right clicking it with an empty hand will pull the items from the inventory required for the recipe and put them into it for quick mass crafting. This only works if it has water.
botania.page.apothecary5=Crafting the &1Petal Apothecary&0.

# -- PURE DAISY
botania.entry.pureDaisy=Pure Daisy
botania.tagline.pureDaisy=Creator of Livingwood and Livingrock, among others
botania.page.pureDaisy0=The &1Pure Daisy&0 is not only the most basic, but also the most important flower a botanist can have.<br>This flower will purify any adjacent &1Wood&0 and &1Stone&0 blocks, as seen on the next page, into their purified counterparts, &1Livingwood&0 and &1Livingrock&0, which can be used for crafting.  
botania.page.pureDaisy1=Just give it &4a minute&0 or so...
botania.page.pureDaisy2=&1Livingwood&0 can be turned into twigs
botania.page.pureDaisy4=A few other blocks can also be purified by placing them around the flower. While not as unique and essential as the living blocks, perhaps this might come in handy. This includes &1Netherrack&0 into &1Cobblestone&0, &1Soul Sand&0 into &1Sand&0, &1Ice&0 into &1Packed Ice&0 or &1Water&0 to &1Snow&0.
botania.page.pureDaisy3=White is bright and pure

# -- WAND OF THE FOREST
botania.entry.wand=Wand of the Forest
botania.tagline.wand=Your essential multitool
botania.page.wand0=The general multi-use tool for a botanist is the &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>This wand, made by, effectively, strapping a pair of &1Mystical Petals&0 of any color to a few &1Livingwood Twigs&0, is required for a good amount of tasks.
botania.page.wand1=The wand has two modes, &4Bind Mode&0 and &4Function Mode&0. In &4Bind Mode&0 it can be shift-right clicked on a compatible block to select it. Shift-right clicking elsewhere binds the two blocks. In &4Function Mode&0 it'll simply not do that for shift-right clicking.<br>The two modes can be switched freely by shift-right clicking on air.
botania.page.wand2=If the wand isn't bound to anything, shift-right clicking a block allows it to be rotated around the axis of the side it's clicked on.<br>For example, clicking on the top of a &1Chest&0 rotates it around. Most blocks which can be rotated should work.
botania.page.wand3=The petals used determine the colors of the wand

# -- RUNIC ALTAR
botania.entry.runeAltar=Runic Altar
botania.tagline.runeAltar=Create runes for stronger flowers and items
botania.page.runeAltar21=Runic creation is a rather important complex in the advancement of the botanical magics. First and foremost, though, this type of crafting requires a decent knowledge of &4Mana Manipulation&0. Before proceeding further, a read through the important entries (those in &oItalics&r) on that section of the &1Lexica Botania&0 might prove enlightening.
botania.page.runeAltar0=&1Runes&0 are extremely important components of complex magical devices or flora.<br>In order to create these, one would require a &1Runic Altar&0.<br>To utilize this &1Runic Altar&0, start by placing, via either a right click or simply tossing, the components to the rune you want to create.
botania.page.runeAltar1=Proceed by pointing a &1Mana Spreader&0 to the altar so that &4Mana&0 transfer can occur.<br>It should be apparent when the altar has received enough &4Mana&0. When that happens, just drop a piece of &1Livingrock&0 on top of it, or right click with it, and use the wand on it again to collect your rune.
botania.page.runeAltar2=Crafting the &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.runeAltar3=A total of 16 &1Runes&0 exist.<br>The most basic and elementary runes are named after the &4Four Elements&0. The intermediate runes are named after the &4Four Seasons&0, and the most advanced runes are named after the &4Seven Deadly Sins&0. A separate &1Rune of Mana&0 also exists.
botania.page.runeAltar20=Sneaking and right-clicking the &1Runic Altar&0 with an empty hand while it's not accepting mana will remove the last item put into it.<br>Last but not least, attaching a &1Comparator&0 to it will emit signal strength &41&0 if the altar is accepting &4Mana&0 and signal strength &42&0 if it's ready to craft the rune.
botania.page.runeAltar22=Any runes used for recipes in the &1Runic Altar&0 function as catalysts, and will be given back upon completion of the rune recipe.<br>Similarly to the &1Petal Apothecary&0, right clicking this block with an empty hand after a recipe is complete will place back the items used for the last recipe for faster mass crafting.
botania.page.runeAltar4=The &1Rune of Water&0.
botania.page.runeAltar5=The &1Rune of Earth&0.
botania.page.runeAltar6=The &1Rune of Air&0.
botania.page.runeAltar7=The &1Rune of Fire&0.
botania.page.runeAltar8=The &1Rune of Spring&0.
botania.page.runeAltar9=The &1Rune of Summer&0.
botania.page.runeAltar10=The &1Rune of Autumn&0.
botania.page.runeAltar11=The &1Rune of Winter&0.
botania.page.runeAltar12=The &1Rune of Mana&0.
botania.page.runeAltar13=The &1Rune of Lust&0.
botania.page.runeAltar14=The &1Rune of Gluttony&0.
botania.page.runeAltar15=The &1Rune of Greed&0.
botania.page.runeAltar16=The &1Rune of Sloth&0.
botania.page.runeAltar17=The &1Rune of Wrath&0.
botania.page.runeAltar18=The &1Rune of Envy&0.
botania.page.runeAltar19=The &1Rune of Pride&0.

# -- TERRASTEEL
botania.entry.terrasteel=Terrasteel
botania.tagline.terrasteel=Powerful metal derived from Mana and nature
botania.page.terrasteel0=&1Terrasteel&0 is a complex magical alloy, infused with a great amount of &4Mana&0. Conjuring it proves not to be a small task. For starters, to create it, one would require a &1Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate&0, set on top of a checkerboard pattern of &1Lapis Lazuli Blocks&0 and &1Livingrock&0. &4Mana&0 would need to be provided to this block, &1Sparks&0 would be the most effective way.
botania.page.terrasteel1=Creating the plate
botania.page.terrasteel2=After the plate is set up and ready to receive &4Mana&0, tossing a single &1Manasteel Ingot, Mana Diamond and Mana Pearl&0 on top of it will begin the infusion.<br>Picking up any of the items will halt the infusion causing severe &4Mana Loss&0. The infusion uses half a &1Mana Pool&0 total to create a single piece of &4Terrasteel&0, multiple &1Sparks&0 would make it go faster, too.
botania.page.terrasteel3=Creating &1Terrasteel&0 (there's &1Livingrock&0 under the plate)
botania.page.terrasteel4=T.A. Plate

# -- BLACK LOTUS
botania.entry.blackLotus=Black Lotus
botania.tagline.blackLotus=Rare loot that can make mana
botania.page.blackLotus0=An elusive flower by the name of &1Black Lotus&0 is known to exist, however, it does not grow or reproduce. Where they can be found or come from is not known.<br>It is known, however, that it contains a strong amount of concentrated &4Mana&0, that can be released by putting it in contact with a &1Mana Pool&0 that already has some in it. Just tossing it would do. 

# -- FLOWER POUCH
botania.entry.flowerBag=Flower Pouch
botania.tagline.flowerBag=A trusty pouch to hold your floral goodness
botania.page.flowerBag0=The laws of physics regarding one's &4Inventory&0 are somewhat skewed in this world. Thanks to that, carrying an array of different colors of flowers turns out to be a major hassle. Luckily, a &1Flower Pouch&0 takes care of all those issues. It can store up to one stack of each color of &1Mystical Flower&0, not only that but it'll passively catch any that enter the holder's inventory.
botania.page.flowerBag2=Items won't be added automatically to the pouch if that's the item being held.<br>Furthermore, shift-right clicking the pouch into a &1Chest&0 or other inventory will store the flowers it contains into said inventory. 
botania.page.flowerBag1=Pull a copter out of it (any colors work)

# -- WRAP
botania.entry.wrap=Wrap
botania.tagline.wrap=It's a wrap
botania.page.wrap0=It seems like the creator of this mod decided to add a weird game mechanic in the form of &1Wrap&0. I don't really know what it does, probably something bad. :/<br>What's this "Fourth Wall" you're talking about...?

# - MANA
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO MANA
botania.entry.mIntro=An Introduction to Mana
botania.tagline.mIntro=Start off with Mana
botania.page.mIntro0=&4Mana&0 is an ethereal substance. In layman's terms, it is a form of &4mystical energy&0. Its sensorial existence is inconstant, and its color depends on the environment its put in.<br>Mastering &4Mana&0 is one of the most important skills a botanist needs to master.
botania.page.mIntro1=In order to create &4Mana&0, one would require a set of &4Generating Flowers&0 (read the respective section). This &4Mana&0 can be dispersed by utilizing &1Mana Spreaders&0 and stored in &1Mana Pools&0. &4Mana&0 can be used for a myriad of different things. For starters, it can be used for &4Functional Flowers&0 (read the respective section).
botania.page.mIntro2=To get started with mastering the art of &4Mana&0, one would start by learning how to use &1Dayblooms&0, &1Mana Spreaders&0 and &1Mana Pools&0.<br>These form a basic infrastructure for mana, which can be used for all sorts of purposes. Have a read at the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Natural Apparatus&0 sections of this Lexicon. 

# -- MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.spreader=Mana Spreader
botania.tagline.spreader=Your essential Mana transporter
botania.page.spreader0=The &1Mana Spreader&0 is the most important component in manipulating &4Mana&0.<br>This is the block that allows &4Mana&0 to travel from point A to point B. When this block is placed on the ground, it'll face one of 6 basic directions. By holding shift-right on it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, one can orient it to the opposite of where it was clicked. It can be pointed to other blocks with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.
botania.page.spreader1=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0
botania.page.spreader2=The &1Mana Spreader&0 has a small internal buffer of &4Mana&0, which will get filled by nearby &4Generating Flowers&0. This buffer can be viewed by looking at the &1Spreader&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, as demonstrated in the last page.<br>Note that the block needs to be right clicked with a wand to get accurate and adequate values.  
botania.page.spreader3=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0 displays a beam which shows where the spreader is pointing at. Hovering over it shows the target. The sparkle that's always shown is the point when &4Mana loss&0 starts to happen.<br>If the target of the spreader is a block that can contain &4Mana&0, and isn't full, the spreader will fire a &4Mana Burst&0, which will travel to the target, and pass the &4Mana&0 along to it.
botania.page.spreader4=The spreader only fires one burst at once, it'll only fire another one when the last one hits the target.<br>Furthermore, the bursts also start suffering &4mana loss&0 after a small amount of time. This can be seen in the beam, which becomes a lot thinner when this happens. There is also a small amount of &4mana loss&0 when a beam enters a spreader.
botania.page.spreader11=Applying a &4Redstone Signal&0 to the spreader will have it cease to function. Case better control is required, a &1Pulse Mana Spreader&0 is recommended, as it can fire bursts without a target block and works on redstone pulses.
botania.page.spreader5=Crafting the &1Mana Spreader&0
botania.page.spreader10=Right clicking the spreader with a piece of &1Wool&0 will sleeve it. Aside from making it look fancier, it'll also muffle the sound when a burst is shot, making it much less obnoxious when there's a large amount of spreaders in one area.<br>Right clicking with an empty hand will remove the sleeve.

# -- MANA POOL
botania.entry.pool=Mana Pool
botania.tagline.pool=Mana storage for the masses
botania.page.pool0=The &1Mana Pool&0 is, simply put, a storage of &4Mana&0.<br>Mana can be inserted into it by usage of a &1Mana Spreader&0, and any adjacent &1Mana Spreaders&0 will pull mana from it to increase their internal buffer automatically.<br>Any &4Functional Flowers&0 require a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 to draw power from.
botania.page.pool9=&1Mana Pools&0 come in two varieties, a weaker, &1Diluted&0 variety which only stores a very small amount of &4Mana&0, and a &1Normal&0 variety, which can store as much as a hundred times more than the dilluted one.<br>Whenever "Mana Pool" is refered elsewhere for scale, it refers to a normal one.
botania.page.pool1=Making a &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.pool10=Making a &1Diluted Mana Pool&0
botania.page.pool14=The &1Diluted Mana Pool&0 can be a useful tool for when one might want a small buffer for a flower or system that doesn't use much &4Mana&0, as the normal pool holds a very large amount of it. Thanks to that, &4Mana&0 readings for the normal pool won't be entirely accurate, due to the scale, it's normal that the displayed bar's size will increase very slowly.
botania.page.pool2=Tossing in some resources into a &1Mana Pool&0 will cause them to get infused with &4Mana&0, turning them into more powerful forms.<br>A few examples are &1Iron Ingots&0 or &1Mana Pearls&0.<br>&4Mana&0 reading for this block functions like the &1Mana Spreader&0. A &1Redstone Comparator&0 can also output a signal based on the contents.
botania.page.pool8=&1Manasteel&0 Ingots and other ingots based on it, can be converted into both blocks or nuggets through the normal conversion recipes.<br>For the artistic types, right clicking with any color of &1Floral Powder&0 in the pool will have it take its color, all sixteen colors are viable for decoration and/or easy labelling.

# -- SPARKS
botania.entry.sparks=Sparks
botania.tagline.sparks=Simple and fast short-range Mana transporters
botania.page.sparks0=&1Sparks&0 are interesting entities. Created from a combination of raw energy and &4Mana&0, they have the ability to be placed on top of a few specific &4Mana&0 containing or accepting blocks, mainly, &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Some blocks have the ability to harness &4Mana&0 from &1Sparks&0, but the uses for them seem limited to a few blocks right now.
botania.page.sparks1=Placing a &1Spark&0 on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 and another on top of a block that can accept it will allow for the latter to remotely access the reservoirs of the &1Mana Pool&0 when needed, given it's not too far away.<br>To remove a &1Spark&0 simply shift-right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. Regular right clicking shows which other &1Sparks&0 it can transfer to.
botania.page.sparks3=In the case that one might think that &1Sparks&0 are too obstrusive in their looks, one can use &1Phantom Ink&0 to turn the target &1Spark&0 highly translucent. This does not consume the ink.

# -- SPARK AUGMENTATION
botania.entry.sparkUpgrades=Spark Augmentation
botania.tagline.sparkUpgrades=Upgrade your Sparks to allow for better functionality
botania.page.sparkUpgrades0=As it seems, &1Sparks&0 are a bit more versatile than it was known previously. A variety of &1Augments&0 can be applied to them to enhance their abilities. It's to note that Augments can only be applied to &1Sparks&0 that lie on &1Mana Pools&0.<br>A &1Spark&0 can only have a single &1Augment&0 at any given time.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades1=Starting off, the &1Dispersive Augment&0 has the &1Spark&0 use up the &4Mana&0 in the pool below, to charge any nearby players' &4Mana&0 containing items.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades2=The &1Dominant Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 pull any &4Mana&0 from nearby non-augmented &1Sparks'&0 pools into its own, until it's completely full.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades3=The &1Recessive Augment&0 will have the &1Spark&0 output all of the &4Mana&0 in its pool into any nearby non-augmented or Dispersive &1Sparks'&0 pools until it's completely empty.
botania.page.sparkUpgrades4=Lastly, the &1Isolated Augment&0 will prevent the &1Spark&0 from interacting with any Dominant or Recessive &1Sparks&0, but still allow it to interact with blocks that can receive their &4Mana&0 through the &1Spark&0 network.

botania.tagline.distributor=Equivalently distribute Mana between various pools
botania.page.distributor0=Any botanist will eventually reach a point where a single &1Mana Pool&0 setup is not enough.<br>The &1Mana Distributor&0 will fix all those issues. By placing it adjacently to a few &1Mana Pools&0 on its sides, when it receives &4Mana&0 through &4Mana Bursts&0 it'll equally spread it to the adjacent pools.

botania.tagline.manaVoid=Destroys all mana that comes into it
botania.page.manaVoid0=The &1Mana Void&0 is, in layman's terms, the grave for &4Mana&0. Any &4Mana&0 shot into this block will simply vanish into the void, never to be seen again.<br>Placing one of these under a &1Mana Pool&0 allows the pool to always accept &4Mana&0, but disposing any it can't hold.
botania.page.manaVoid1=Even Chad from accounting?

# -- MANA FLUXFIELD
botania.entry.rfGenerator=Mana Fluxfield
botania.tagline.rfGenerator=Converts Mana into Redstone Flux
botania.page.rfGenerator0=By passing &4Mana&0 through a field of redstone energy, its state can change from a natural energy source to &4Redstone Flux&0.<br>Simply pointing a spreader at this block will have it shoot at it, converting the &4Mana&0 that lands on it into &4RF&0. It can then be pulled out with any &4RF&0 transporter.
botania.page.rfGenerator1=The bullet guys. I bit it.

# -- MANA LENSES
botania.entry.lens=Mana Lenses
botania.tagline.lens=Varied augmentations for your spreaders
botania.page.lens0=In order to upgrade the potential a &1Mana Spreader&0, one can apply &1Mana Lenses&0. The very basic mana lens does absolutely nothing.<br>Lenses can be &4dyed&0, in a workbench, all the 16 colors of the spectrum, or combined with a &1Mana Pearl&0 to create a &1Rainbow Lens&0. These will change the color of the burst.
botania.page.lens1=The basic lens, it doesn't do anything.
botania.page.lens2=&4Dyeing&0 lenses!
botania.page.lens3=&1Rainbow Lens&0 all the way
botania.page.lens4=But lenses are not only for fancy colors. One can upgrade them with all sorts of materials to create new lens which can do all sorts of effects on the &4Mana Bursts&0.<br>It's to take in mind that, if using a normal &1Mana Spreader&0, there needs to be a &4Mana&0 receiving block at the end for the burst to fire. A &1Pulse Mana Spreader&0 is recommended for some lenses.
botania.page.lens5=Sometimes, though, having a single &1Mana Lens&0 in a spreader just isn't enough sometimes. By combining two lenses with a &1Slimeball&0 in a crafting table, it's possible to unite them into one, and keep the effects of both.<br>The first lens used determines the visuals (texture and color). It's to note that some combinations will not work, nor will two lenses of the same type.
botania.page.lens6=The &1Velocity Lens&0 will drastically increase the speed at which a &4Mana Burst&0 travels, but not only does the beam start to lose its &4Mana&0 a lot faster, it can also carry a bit less.
botania.page.lens7=Velocity Lens
botania.page.lens8=The &1Potency Lens&0 will double the amount of &4Mana&0 a &4Mana Burst&0 can carry, however, the beam becomes slower and after it starts to lose mana it does so at a lot faster rate.
botania.page.lens9=Potency Lens
botania.page.lens10=The &1Resistance Lens&0 will significantly increase the amount of time the &4Mana Burst&0 can go without starting to lose &4Mana&0, but it makes it a a bit slower.
botania.page.lens11=Resistance Lens
botania.page.lens12=The &1Efficiency Lens&0 will decrease the amount of time it takes for the &4Mana Burst&0 to start losing its &4Mana&0, but when that happens, it does so at a lot slower rate.
botania.page.lens13=Efficiency Lens 
botania.page.lens14=The &1Bounce Lens&0 will allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to bounce off walls, rather than dissipating on a collision.
botania.page.lens15=Bounce Lens
botania.page.lens16=The &1Gravity Lens&0 makes the &4Mana Burst&0 be attracted by the world's gravitational pull, thus moving in an arc. As compensation, it also slightly increases the time before &4Mana&0 loss starts to happen.
botania.page.lens17=Gravity Lens 
botania.page.lens18=The &1Bore Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the ability to break any blocks it comes into contact with, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens19=Bore Lens 
botania.page.lens20=The &1Damaging Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the power to damage any living beings it comes across, draining its own mana to do so.
botania.page.lens21=Damaging Lens
botania.page.lens22=The &1Phantom Lens&0 is an interesting one. By utilizing the &1Abstruse Platform&0 and its' properties, it's possible to make a lens that'll allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to pass through blocks. In doing so, the time it can stay without losing mana is decreased.
botania.page.lens23=Phantom Lens
botania.page.lens24=The &1Magnetizing Lens&0, as its name states, allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to magnetize, or home in, on any nearby blocks that can receive &4Mana&0. Doing so slightly decreases the speed of the burst.
botania.page.lens25=Magnetizing Lens
botania.page.lens26=The &1Entropic Lens&0 imbues the &4Mana Burst&0 with entropy, causing it to release its energy in the form of an explosion when it collides against something that can't receive &4Mana&0.
botania.page.lens27=Entropic Lens
botania.page.lens28=The &1Influence Lens&0 allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to have influence over any nearby &4dropped items&0, &4experience orbs&0 and even &4falling blocks&0, having them move in the exact same vector of motion as the burst itself.
botania.page.lens29=Influence Lens
botania.page.lens30=The &1Weight Lens&0 carries a strong burden on the &4Mana Burst&0, making any block hit by it, if there doesn't happen to be a block below it, fall, similarly to how &1Sand&0 and &1Gravel&0 do.
botania.page.lens31=Weight Lens
botania.page.lens32=The &1Kindle Lens&0 is infused with a burning spark, when it hits a block it'll set it on fire. It has the ability to both ignite and close &1Nether Portals&0. It doesn't seem to set any living beings on fire, though.
botania.page.lens33=Kindle Lens
botania.page.lens34=The &1Force Lens&0 acts as a &1Piston&0, when it hits a block that a piston can move, it'll do just so.
botania.page.lens35=Force Lens
botania.page.lens36=The &1Flash Lens&0, in contact with a block, creates a flame of the same color as the burst that caused it. The flame provides light and is purely decorative.<br>If it hits one of these flames, it puts it out instead.
botania.page.lens37=Flash Lens

# -- MANA TABLET
botania.entry.manaTablet=Mana Tablet
botania.tagline.manaTablet=Portable Mana Storage 
botania.page.manaTablet0=While using &1Mana Spreaders&0 to transport &4Mana&0 around is all well and good, there is also a way of doing it in a different manner.<br>The &1Mana Tablet&0 is a portable object which can carry &4Mana&0 on itself.<br>Not only that, but other items can also pull from it as they need it for their uses, making this an essential tool.
botania.page.manaTablet1=Tossing one of these on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 will allow for transport of &4Mana&0 between one and another.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Mana Pool&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will change in which way the &4Mana&0 flows.<br>Lastly, unlike normal items, these will never despawn when dropped on the floor.
botania.page.manaTablet2=Don't put it on your pocket, it might bend

# -- MANA MIRROR
botania.entry.manaMirror=Mana Mirror
botania.tagline.manaMirror=Remote Portable Mana Access
botania.page.manaMirror0=A &1Mana Mirror&0 is an alternative to &4Mana&0 containing items such as a &1Mana Tablet&0. It can be bound to a &1Mana Pool&0 in the world and items will pull out of the pool itself when needing &4Mana&0.<br>To bind a mirror to a pool, one would simply &4shift right-click&0 a pool with the mirror. The mirror can't put mana in or take mana out of pools in any other way.
botania.page.manaMirror1=Mirror mirror on the wall...

# -- MANA DETECTOR
botania.entry.manaDetector=Mana Detector
botania.tagline.manaDetector=Detects Mana Bursts and emits Redstone signals
botania.page.manaDetector0=A device like the &1Mana Detector&0 is capable to detect when a &4Mana Burst&0 starts flowing through it (the burst doesn't dissipate on collision with this block) and provide a redstone signal when that is the case.
botania.page.manaDetector1=Crafting the detector

# -- PULSE MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.redstoneSpreader=Pulse Mana Spreader
botania.tagline.redstoneSpreader=A spreader that fires on a Redstone pulse
botania.page.redstoneSpreader0=By combining a &1Mana Spreader&0 with a piece of &1Redstone&0, it's possible to create a &1Pulse Mana Spreader&0, which, as the name implies, fires when given a &4Redstone pulse&0, regardless of having a block in the end to put the &4Mana&0 or not.<br>It's to keep in note that this doesn't let the spreader shoot a burst until the last one dissipates or is absorbed.
botania.page.redstoneSpreader1=Just add redstone

# -- MANASTAR
botania.entry.manastar=Manastar
botania.tagline.manastar=A flower for classifying mana loss or income
botania.page.manastar0=The imprecise measurements of the &1Wand of the Forest&0 sometimes won't cut it for telling if you're turning a profit or loss in your &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Creating a &1Manastar&0 and placing it next to your pools will have it shine red if there's a loss or blue if there's a profit. The measurement happens every few seconds.
botania.page.manastar1=&rI'm a shooting star leaping through the skies&r.

# -- ELVEN MANA SPREADERS
botania.entry.dreamwoodSpreader=Elven Mana Spreaders
botania.tagline.dreamwoodSpreader=Harder, better, faster, stronger
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader0=Simply put, &1Dreamwood&0 conducts &4Mana&0 better than &1Livingwood&0. Add in some adjustments like using &1Elementium&0 instead of &1Gold&0 and what you get is a &1Mana Spreader&0 that can conduct more &4Mana&0, faster and for more time without &4Mana loss&0.<br>On the negative side, it can't be turned into a &1Pulse Mana Spreader&0.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader1=Better spreaders, that's it
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader2=By combining this already powerful spreader with a &1Gaia Spirit&0 and a &1Dragonstone&0 gem, one can create an even more potent variant. The &1Gaia Spreader&0 is within the top percentage of Mana Spreaders, with pretty much upgrades all round.<br>It's to note that these spreaders fire a larger payload at once and thus, might fire less often.
botania.page.dreamwoodSpreader3=ULTRA_SPREADER

# -- ELVEN MANA LENSES
botania.entry.elvenLenses=Elven Mana Lenses
botania.tagline.elvenLenses=Advanced Mana Lenses with new abilities
botania.page.elvenLenses0=The knowledge of mana handling methods of alfheim comes, of course, with an array of new &1Mana Lenses&0 that can be experimented with.<br>Unlike common overworld-y lenses, these are a bit more ubiquitous in their uses...
botania.page.elvenLenses1=First off, the &1Paintslinger Lens&0. This lens needs to be dyed one of the 16 colors of the spectrum to function. When a burst with its effect hits a colorable block (&1Wool, Stained Clay or Glass&0...) it'll turn any blocks connected, of the same type and color, into the color of the &4Mana Burst&0 itself. It seems to work with &4Sheep&0 too.
botania.page.elvenLenses2=Paintslinger Lens
botania.page.elvenLenses3=The &1Warp Lens&0 is an interesting one. A burst with its effect, when colliding with a &1Force Relay&0 will teleport to the end position of said &1Force Relay&0, maintaining its momentum. Furthermore, when it's used as a composite material to a &1Bore Lens&0 (the &1Bore Lens&0 must be visible) it'll make the lens not break &1Force Relays&0 or &1Pistons&0, as well as teleport any blocks to the spot where the burst was fired.
botania.page.elvenLenses4=Warp Lens
botania.page.elvenLenses5=The &1Redirective Lens&0 will only work when fired from a &1Mana Spreader&0. Any burst with its effect that would collide against a &1Mana Spreader&0, aside from the normal &4Mana&0 transfer interaction, also makes the spreader point towards the one that fired the burst.
botania.page.elvenLenses6=Redirective Lens
botania.page.elvenLenses7=The &1Celebratory Lens&0 functions much akin to the common &1Entropic Lens&0, however, instead of exploding, it creates a festive firework dyed the color of the burst.
botania.page.elvenLenses8=Celebratory Lens
botania.page.elvenLenses9=The &1Flare Lens&0 takes over a &1Mana Spreader&0's functionality, preventing it from firing any bursts. Instead, the spreader becomes a continuous particle burst of the color the lens is dyed, in the direction the spreader is firing.<br>There's surely plenty of decorative uses for this.
botania.page.elvenLenses10=Flare Lens

# -- MANA PRISM
botania.entry.prism=Mana Prism
botania.tagline.prism=Switch a Mana Burst's effective Lens on the fly
botania.page.prism0=The concept of &1Mana Lens&0 allows for the manipulation of the power convyed through &4Mana Bursts&0, the &1Mana Prism&0 works on that technology to allow a burst to have its lens effect switched on the fly.<br>Using a &1Spectral Platform&0 as a component, this block does not have a physical presence, entities and bursts can go through it as if it doesn't exist.
botania.page.prism1=Right clicking it with any variety of &1Mana Lens&0 sets the lens in the prism. Whenever a &4Mana Burst&0 goes through the prism, its color and effect will be set to that of the lens in the prism. Case the lens is not dyed, the burst will turn white.<br>Using any of the four basic lenses also increases the time the burst can go before losing &4Mana&0, allowing it to go further.
botania.page.prism2=It can also be turned off by the use of a redstone signal.
botania.page.prism3=Another pixel in the wall

# -- MANA ON RAILS
botania.entry.poolCart=Mana on Rails
botania.tagline.poolCart=This is not a web framework
botania.page.poolCart0=What could be an easier way to transport &4Mana&0 over large distances than attaching a &1Mana Pool&0 to a &1Minecart&0 and watch it do the merry-go-round? It's simple. Similarly to other types of carts, one can create a &1Minecart with Mana Pool&0 that can store and transport &4Mana&0 on rails.<br>Breaking the cart while there's any &4Mana&0 in it will waste the &4Mana&0, care should be taken with it.
botania.page.poolCart1=Transfering &4Mana&0 between the cart and a pool is done with a &1Mana Pump&0. It can face any of the four cardinal directions and will transfer &4Mana&0 between a pool adjacent to it and a cart with a pool on an rail opposite to the target pool.<br>The transfer rate is extremely fast due to the mechanical nature, so fast that overflow is possible, causing &4Mana Loss&0.
botania.page.poolCart2=The side of the pump where the &4Mana&0 will go towards is the pink one, &4Mana&0 is pulled from the blue side.<br>The pump can be turned off with redstone, and a &1Comparator&0 on it will output how much &4Mana&0 exists in the cart.<br>Lastly, a pool on a cart serves purely for transport, and can not receive, send, transfer or infuse any items with its &4Mana&0.
botania.page.poolCart3=I like trains

# -- SPARK TINKERER
botania.entry.sparkChanger=Spark Tinkerer

botania.page.sparkChanger0=The &1Spark Tinkerer&0 is a block with the ability to modify the &1Augments&0 placed on &1Sparks&0. Placing it adjacent to &1Mana Pools&0 or other blocks with a &1Spark&0 attached will connect it to those blocks.<br>Right clicking the &1Spark Tinkerer&0 with a &1Spark Augment&0 will put the augment in the block, it can be removed by right clicking again. 
botania.page.sparkChanger1=When the &1Spark Tinkerer&0 gets a redstone signal it'll randomly pick a &1Spark&0, between all of those it's connected to that have a different augment from the one stored in it, and swap the augment in that &1Spark&0 with the one stored in the block.<br>The stored augment can be withdrawn or deposited with &1Hoppers&0 or other automation methods. &1Comparators&0 can read what augment is stored.

botania.tagline.bellows=Make Mana Pools' transferring and Furnaces faster
botania.page.bellows0=&1Manatide Bellows&0 are a simple device with the purpose of increasing the speed &1Mana Pools&0 output transfer rate.<br>Placing these bellows next to, and pointing towards, a &1Mana Pool&0 will increase the speed at which the pool outputs its &4Mana&0 into &1Mana Tablets&0 or other items. Multiple bellows will work at increasing further the transfer rate.
botania.page.bellows1=A slightly less interesting ability of the &1Manatide Bellows&0 is to stoke a &1Furnace&0's flames.<br>&1Manatide Bellows&0 can be utilized manually via a right click. Pointing the bellows towards an active &1Furnace&0 and manning them will increase the speed and efficiency at which the items in the &1Furnace&0 get smelted.

botania.page.fIntro0=There are various places in which the &4Mana&0 a botanist generates can be put to use, one of them is an assortment of &4Functional Flowers&0.<br>These flowers will drain &4Mana&0 from a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 into themselves, in order to do whatever task they were created for.<br>It's to note that these can't receive power directly through &1Mana Spreaders&0.
botania.page.fIntro1=All &4Functional Flowers&0, alike the &4Generating Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.
botania.page.fIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Pool&0 from which they should pull &4Mana&0 out of. They'll only pull from the nearest pool present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other. It can be bound to another pool with a wand in &4Bind Mode&0.
botania.page.fIntro3=Lastly, some functional flowers utilize a &1Redstone Root&0 in their creation. If they do, the flower's effect can be toggled with a redstone signal.

# -- FLOWER SHRINKING
botania.entry.flowerShrinking=Flower Shrinking
botania.tagline.flowerShrinking=Smaller flowers with a smaller range
botania.page.flowerShrinking0=Some functional flowers have a bit too much reach. Sometimes one might not want that to be the case. Tossing one of those few flowers into a &1Mana Pool&0 with an &1Alchemy Catalyst&0 will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0, shrink it, making its radius smaller. Every other function remains the same.<br>This can also be done for passive generating flowers, turning them into decorative versions that don't decay.

botania.tagline.flowerSpeed=Changing how long flowers take to work
botania.page.flowerSpeed0=A problem with &4Functional Flowers&0 that interact with dropped items on the floor is making sure the items are interacted with in the right order.<br>Planting the relevant flowers under &1Podzol&0 will add a small delay before they can pick up items, allowing for a "priority" system of sorts. Planting a flower on &1Mycellium&0 will create a larger delay.
botania.page.flowerSpeed1=This system also extends to &1Floating Flowers&0, via the use of &1Boreal Seeds&0 and &1Infestation Spores&0.<br>Given two flowers with the same delay (or none), a &4Generating Flower&0 (e.g. &1Endoflame&0) will pick up an item before a &4Functional One&0.

botania.page.manaEnchanting0=By utilizing the magical power emitted from &1Mana Pylons&0, a structure that can enchant items with books without consuming them can be created, called the &1Mana Enchanter&0.<br>Constructing one of these requires a fair amount of space and materials alike.
botania.page.manaEnchanting1=To construct the &1Mana Enchanter&0, one requires, as well as fair amount of space, 17 &1Obsidian&0 blocks, 10 &1Mystical Flowers&0 of any color, 6 &1Mana Pylons&0 and a &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0.<br>The instructions on how to assemble this structure are in the following pages.
botania.page.manaEnchanting2=Mana Enchanter
botania.page.manaEnchanting5=After the construct is done, right click the Lapis block with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 and the enchanter should form.<br>In order to utilize the enchanter, one would place (via right click) the item to be enchanted in the enchanter itself and drop &1Enchanted Books&0 inside the circle around it.
botania.page.manaEnchanting6=Items that are already enchanted can't be placed in the enchanter.<br>To start the enchanting, right click the enchanter with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. It'll scan the books around, and once it's done, a spell circle of sorts will appear around it, indicating the books can be safely picked up again.
botania.page.manaEnchanting7=After the enchanting begins, the enchanter will require &4Mana&0.<br>It can be fed via one of two ways, either via &4Mana Bursts&0 or nearby &1Sparks&0, by placing a &1Spark&0 on top of the enchanter. The later being much faster.
botania.page.manaEnchanting8=When enough &4Mana&0 is gathered, the enchanting process will finalize, and the enchantments will be applied to the item.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required depends on the rarity of the enchantments being applied, their level, and the total amount of enchantments.<br>If any book has more than one enchantment, only the first will be accounted for.
botania.page.manaEnchanting9=During the enchanting process, the item can not be removed, but it can after the process has been completed.<br>Note that if at any point, any component of the construct is removed, it'll revert to its original &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0 form.

botania.tagline.brewery=Create brews, more effective potions
botania.page.brewery0=Given the versatility of &4Mana&0, the fact that it can be used to conjure some sort of &4Potions&0 comes to nobody's surprise. &4Brews&0 are a variant of &4Potions&0, to put it simply. They're created using &4Mana&0 and a set of ingredients.<br>Unlike &4Potions&0, &4Brews&0 have defined recipes, and each vial contains multiple doses.
botania.page.brewery1=In order to create &4Brews&0 one would require a &1Botanical Brewery&0, &1Vials&0 and of course, the reagents defined in the recipe.<br>The &4Mana&0 functions as the both the solvent and energy source and is given through &4Mana Bursts&0, simply pointing a &1Mana Spreader&0 at the &1Brewery&0 will work just fine.
botania.page.brewery2=Crafting the &1Botanical Brewery&0
botania.page.brewery3=Crafting &1Vials&0

First off, to add an item, right click with it on the block or toss it.<br>Start off by adding the &1Vial&0, which will get set on the top of the brewery. Proceed by adding all the required ingredients. Once a &4Brew&0 can be created with the ingredients in the brewery, &4Mana&0 will start flowing, just wait a bit after that.

botania.page.flasks1=While the ingredient cost to brew something in a &1Flask&0 is smaller, the &4Mana&0 cost is double that of a regular &1Vial&0.<br>Lastly, given that the bottleneck of a &1Flask&0 is larger than that of a &1Vial&0, the contents can be consumed faster.

# -- BREW INCENSES
botania.entry.incense=Brew Incenses
botania.tagline.incense=Brews on an area of effect
botania.page.incense0=&4Brews&0 can provide a great variety of effects when in liquid form. They, however, don't last long, and take up inventory space. Utilizing &1Incense Sticks&0 instead of flasks mitigates that problem, these can be infused with &4Brew&0 effects just like a normal flask would, but take around ten times as much &4Mana&0 to do so.
botania.page.incense1=An &1Incense Stick&0 can be placed on an &1Incense Plate&0 by right clicking on it, a simple click with a &1Flint and Steel&0 will light it up. Once lit, the stick can not be retrieved.<br>A single stick of incense will burn for sixty times as long as as the liquid counterpart before needing to be replaced.  
botania.page.incense2=&1Incense Plates&0 that are burning &1Incense Sticks&0 will provide the effects of the &4Brew&0 infused in the stick to any players on a 30 block radius of the plate.<br>Not all &4Brews&0 can be infused into &1Incense Sticks&0, for example, &4Instant Health&0 or &1Absorption&0 can't, nor can any with more than one effect.
botania.page.incense5=For the incense lovers who are also automation junkies, the &1Incense Plate&0 can receive items through &1Hoppers&0 or other input. It'll output a &1Comparator&0 signal of 1 when it has a stick and 2 when it's burning it.<br>Lastly, if a &4Mana Burst&0 with a &1Kindle Lens&0 hits the plate while there's a stick on it, it'll start burning it.

botania.page.forestEye1=The counting only starts at 2, so, with 2 animals around, it'd output a signal of strength 1, with 3 animals, of strength 2 and so on.<br>Lastly, the time has worn down the sight of the Ancients, so this block can only see animals in about 6 blocks in any direction.

# -- OPEN CRATE
botania.entry.openCrate=Open Crate
botania.tagline.openCrate=A simple device to drop things
botania.page.openCrate0=Sometimes devices like &1Droppers&0 or &1Dispensers&0 aren't precise or fast enough. A simple solution is to make a crate and punch a hole in the bottom.<br>Yeah, it's that simple. The &1Open Crate&0 accepts items from &1Hoppers&0 or any other means of inserting items, and obviously, drops them directly below it.
botania.page.openCrate1=Depending on the situation, items can be inserted into the open crate with a &1Hopper&0, &1Hopperhock&0 or &1Dropper&0.<br>A little interesting effect the &1Open Crate&0 can do is that, when given a redstone signal, any items it drops are prevented from being caught by flowers like the &1Hopperhock&0, &1Rannuncarpus&0 or &1Pollidisiac&0 for around ten seconds more than usual.
botania.page.openCrate2=A super crate box

# -- DRUM OF THE WILD
botania.entry.forestDrum=Drum of the Wild
botania.tagline.forestDrum=Harvest crops and uproot grass with mana bursts
botania.page.forestDrum0=The &1Drum of the Wild&0 is, in layman's terms, the percussion counterpart of the &1Horn of the Wild&0. It serves the exact same purpose as the handheld horn, but is placed in world.<br>To trigger a beat and break nearby foliage, one would fire a &4Mana Burst&0 at the drum.
botania.page.forestDrum1=It's to note that the drum does not store mana, hence, in order to trigger it, a &1Pulse Mana Spreader&0 or a &1Mana Blaster&0 is required.

botania.page.platform0=By laying &1Livingwood&0 on a very specific format it's possible to create a platform of sorts, that only has a physical body for whoever is on top of it and isn't sneaking. For anyone else, it's like it's not there. &4Mana Bursts&0 will always travel through it without any trouble.<br>It's also possible to camouflage this block as any other simple block by simply right clicking it.
botania.page.platform2=Right clicking a platform with a block in it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will change all connected platforms with no block set to them to the block on the one clicked. Shift-right clicking removes all blocks.

Any &4Cows&0, with &1Empty Buckets&0 below them will have their milk transfered to the buckets.
botania.page.gatherDrum1=Tap your lands

# -- CRAFTY CRATE
botania.entry.craftCrate=Crafty Crate
botania.tagline.craftCrate=A way to craft automatically
botania.page.craftCrate0=As the name suggests, the &1Crafty Crate&0 is a counterpart to the &1Open Crate&0 with the ability to assemble items into other items similarly to a &1Crafting Table&0.<br>Like a &1Crafting Table&0, it has a 9 slot inventory, which can be filled with items in the pattern of a recipe.
botania.page.craftCrate1=The items go in from left to right and top to bottom (illustration further in this entry), to that, there's a special item, named the &1Crafting Placeholder&0, which, when placed in, counts as an empty slot in the recipe. This is used to allow for recipes with gaps (eg, furnace, chest, pickaxe...) to also be doable.
botania.page.craftCrate2=Creating the placeholder
botania.page.craftCrate3=To finish the recipe, one of two things can be done.<br>First off, filling every of the 9 slots with either recipe components or placeholders will instantly eject the result, the placeholders and any leftovers (e.g. buckets when making cake), this is the most straightforward method.
botania.page.craftCrate4=Right clicking the crate with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 (remember: &1Dispensers&0 can do this) will attempt at crafting with whatever is inside the crate and eject it.<br>If this fails all the items inside are simply ejected with no crafting procedure done.
botania.page.craftCrate7=Attaching a &1Comparator&0 to the crate will have it emit a signal equal to the amount of items inside the crate, which can be an extremely valuable asset in creating mechanisms with it.
botania.page.craftCrate5=An example of crafting a &1Diamond Pickaxe&0
botania.page.craftCrate6=Made in Portugal
botania.page.craftCrate8=The &1Crafty Crate&0 can also be augmented with patterns. A pattern locks specific slots in the recipe, disallowing items from going into those slots and making them count as if there were placeholders there.<br>There's only a few basic patterns, which can be applied by right clicking on the crate (this doesn't consume them).
botania.page.craftCrate9=9 different patterns

# -- HOVERING HOURGLASS
botania.entry.hourglass=Hovering Hourglass
botania.tagline.hourglass=A simple timer, using the sands of time
botania.page.hourglass0=The ability to count time is an essential one to anyone who wishes to develop any redstonic contraptions. A single timer, however, can take a up both a lot of space and be slow in general. The &1Hovering Hourglass&0 is a simple, accurate, sand based timer. As the name implies, it's a hourglass that hovers and turns by itself.
botania.page.hourglass1=The hourglass contains an inventory, in which up to a stack of &1Sand&0, &1Red Sand&0 or &1Soul Sand&0 can be added via a right click. Right clicking again removes it. The sand will then fall from one of the chambers into another, and when is done, release a single redstone pulse and turn over, starting the process again.
botania.page.hourglass2=The amount of time for each pulse is dependent on how much and what type of sand is in the chamber. &1Sand&0 will count for one second per block, &1Red Sand&0 ten seconds per and &1Soul Sand&0 one minute per. Sand types can't be mixed. The time for each pulse can be seen by hovering over the block with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.
botania.page.hourglass3=Note that the sand is added all at once, so the size of the stack to be added needs to be set in the inventory.<br>Sand can't be added to the hourglass after it already has some in, trying to do so will end up removing the sand there instead. The sand in the block can be taken and added by &1Hoppers&0 or other methods.
botania.page.hourglass4=Right clicking the block with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 locks (and unlocks) it. When locked, sand can't be added or removed, just in case someone right clicks it on accident.<br>If a &4Mana Burst&0 collides with the block, it'll stop the flow of sand and pause the timer, colliding again continues it.
botania.page.hourglass5=The sands of time

# -- SPECTRAL RAIL

# -- COCOON OF CAPRICE
botania.entry.cocoon=Cocoon of Caprice
botania.tagline.cocoon=Hatch your own animals
botania.page.cocoon0=A cocoon is usually a symbol of change, of evolution.<br>Creating a &1Cocoon of Caprice&0 and placing it down will slowly evolve the rudimentary contents inside it into a &1Baby Animal&0. More often than not the animal hatched will be a farm animal, but on rare ocasions, different animals such as &1Wolves&0 or &1Horses&0 may be created.
botania.page.cocoon1=Speculation says that giving the cocoon &1Emeralds&0 influences the outcome towards something a bit different.<br>What could come out of such experiment is anyone's guess, really.

botania.page.manaBomb0=Putting together some &1TNT&0 and a &1Gaia Spirit&0 creates a &1Manastorm Charge&0, a type of explosive, per se. Ignited with a &1Mana Burst&0, the charge will create an unstable &1Manastorm Epicenter&0, which will, over time, spawn supercharged &1Mana Bursts&0, that explode on contact with other blocks.<br>Needless to say, only a maniac would unleash such a force near anything they care about.

botania.page.teruTeruBozu0=&1Teru Teru Bozu&0 are known as amulets that can ward away bad weather. Simply creating one of these and placing it in the world will decrease the amount of time that &1Rain&0 or &1Snowstorms&0 will last. During bad weather, right clicking one with a &1Sunflower&0 or tossing said flower at it will have the sun come back. Attaching a &1Redstone Comparator&0 to one of these allows for it to detect bad weather.

# -- LIVINGWOOD AVATAR
botania.entry.avatar=Livingwood Avatar
botania.tagline.avatar=Rod effects in a block
botania.page.avatar0=Carving some &1Livingwood&0 and combining it with a &1Mana Diamond&0 heart creates an apparatus known as the &1Livingwood Avatar&0. By itself, this block doesn't do anything, aside from looking reasonably pretty.<br>However, giving it a &4Rod&0 can enable it to cast varied magic, depending on which one is given. At the cost of &4Mana&0, from a spreader, of course.
botania.page.avatar1=Not all &4Rods&0 fit this criteria. Any that do, however, will have an explanation of what they can do when given to a &1Livingwood Avatar&0 on their entry.<br>A few examples of some rods that will work are the &1Rod of the Skies&0, &1Rod of the Hells&0 and &1Rod of the Plentiful Mantle&0.
botania.page.avatar2=But is it an anime?

# -- FEL PUMPKIN
botania.entry.felPumpkin=Fel Pumpkin
botania.tagline.felPumpkin=A pumpkin that can spawn blazes
botania.page.felPumpkin0=A &1Fel Pumpkin&0 is a demented infusion of a &1Pumpkin&0 with the fel spirits of slain monsters. This vile pumpkin can be placed atop two &1Iron Bars&0, in a similar fashion to a &1Snow Golem&0, to spawn a &1Blaze&0.<br>&1Blazes&0 spawned with this method drop a fairly reasonable amount of &1Blaze Powder&0 instead of a small serving of &1Blaze Rods&0.
botania.page.felPumpkin1=Nerfing warlocks again

# - MYSTICAL INSTRUMENTS
# -- MANA BLASTER
botania.entry.manaBlaster=Mana Blaster
botania.tagline.manaBlaster=Portable Mana Spreader, with lenses!
botania.page.manaBlaster0=The &1Mana Blaster&0 is like a portable &1Mana Spreader&0, while shaped like a pistol for easy handling, it's not exactly a firearm, as much as it is just a portable spreader.<br>By utilizing &4Mana&0 from &4Mana carrying items&0 in the holder's inventory, it can shoot a mana burst wherever one is looking.
botania.page.manaBlaster1=This burst is a bit different from the one fired from speaders, as it's faster, but carries only three quarters of the mana a spreader burst would. There's also a short cooldown period after firing the blaster until another burst can be shot.
botania.page.manaBlaster2=&1Mana Lenses&0 also function with the blaster. To attach one to it, put them side by side on a crafting table, to remove it, simply place the &1Mana Blaster&0 back on the crafting grid.<br>If the shooter has a &1Haste&0 effect present on their person, the speed at which they can fire the blaster also increases. 
botania.page.manaBlaster3=We need more dakka

# -- PASTURE SEEDS
botania.entry.grassSeeds=Pasture Seeds
botania.tagline.grassSeeds=Seeds to create Grass, Podzol and Mycelium
botania.page.grassSeeds0=Watching grass spread is seldom a fun activity. By infusing some &1Tall Grass&0 with &4Mana&0, it's possible to create &1Pasture Seeds&0, which will grow grass in any barren area, via a simple right click on dirt.<br>Other types of foliage can also be grown, such a &1Podzol&0 or &1Mycellium&0 with alternate seeds.
botania.page.grassSeeds1=&1Pasture Seeds&0 for grass
botania.page.grassSeeds2=&1Boreal Seeds&0 for podzol
botania.page.grassSeeds3=&1Infestation Spores&0 for mycelium
botania.page.grassSeeds4=An additional six types of &1Pasture Seeds&0 can be created, for alternative grass types with various textures.<br>These spread to dirt like normal and can sustain any plant a block of grass can. Similarly, they may only be picked up with &4Silk Touch&0. However, they do not decay back into dirt if there's a block above them.
botania.page.grassSeeds5=The alternate &1Pasture Seeds&0

# -- ROD OF THE LANDS
botania.entry.dirtRod=Rod of the Lands
botania.tagline.dirtRod=A rod to create dirt
botania.page.dirtRod0=The &1Rod of the Lands&0 is a rather simple tool; by utilizing &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory (via a &1Mana Tablet&0 or others), it can materialize and place a &1Dirt&0 block down.<br>For the same &4Mana&0 cost, this item can provide &1Dirt&0 to the &1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0.
botania.page.dirtRod1=The Dirty Stick

# -- TERRA FIRMA ROD
botania.entry.terraformRod=Rod of the Terra Firma
botania.tagline.terraformRod=A rod to terraform
botania.page.terraformRod0=While digging away at dirt with a shovel is definitely functional, flattening huge tracts of land can get somewhat tortuous at times.<br>By utilizing the &1Rod of the Terra Firma&0, it's possible to terraform in a quick and environmental friendly manner.
botania.page.terraformRod1=This rod, will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory, flatten the land to the level you are standing. For this to happen, charge it by &4holding right-click&0 and, slowly but surely, the nearby terrain will be flattened to your level, either by placing &1Dirt&0 or by removing blocks.
botania.page.terraformRod2=Note that blocks removed by the rod are non-recuperable. The terrain will adapt to the changes as best as it can, up to a distance limit, to avoid cuts in hills and the like, for this, the flattening will work in the terrain's natural look.<br>Lastly, the rod will cease to function whatsoever below sea level.
botania.page.terraformRod3=Quite a justicar

# -- MANASTEEL EQUIPMENT
botania.entry.manaGear=Manasteel Equipment
botania.tagline.manaGear=Iron-tier equipment that repairs itself with Mana
botania.page.manaGear0=&1Manasteel&0, like other metals, can be shaped into tools and armor alike.<br>Tools or armor crafted from this material will share their properties with &1Iron&0, albeit somewhat superior in enchantability and durability. Whenever a &1Manasteel&0 item is to take damage, if there's &4Mana&0 available in the inventory (such as a &1Mana Tablet&0), it'll use that instead.
botania.page.manaGear10=Some pieces of the toolset have an ability when right clicked. The &1Pickaxe&0 will place a torch from the user's inventory, the &1Axe&0 will do the same for a sapling and the &1Shovel&0 will till the earth, similarly to a hoe.<br>A detail to keep in mind is that &1Shears&0 made of mana materials will trigger tripwire, unlike iron ones.
botania.page.manaGear1=The &1Manasteel Pickaxe&0

botania.tagline.grassHorn=Reap all grass and crops around you
botania.page.grassHorn0=Clearing out &1Tall Grass&0 by hand can definitely be a nuisance.<br>Simply blowing the &1Horn of the Wild&0 will quickly cause any nearby vegetation to uproot, leaving behind drops as if it had been broken by hand.<br>With some modifications, the horn can be modified to break leaves or snow instead.

# -- TERRASTEEL ARMOR
botania.entry.terrasteelArmor=Terrasteel Armor
botania.tagline.terrasteelArmor=Diamond-tier armor with Manasteel properties
botania.page.terrasteelArmor0=Armor made out of &1Terrasteel&0, much like its &1Manasteel&0 counterpart, can utilize &4Mana&0 from the inventory instead of taking damage.<br>This armor, however, has properties more like &1Diamond&0 instead of &1Iron&0.
botania.page.terrasteelArmor1=The &1Terrasteel Helmet&0

# -- TERRA BLADE
botania.entry.terraSword=Terra Blade
botania.tagline.terraSword=A sword that fires a beam that damages mobs
botania.page.terraSword0=The &1Terra Blade&0, crafted from &1Terrasteel Ingots&0, is a sword infused with natural strength. Not only does it par with a &1Diamond Sword&0 in terms of strength and it uses &4Mana&0 from the inventory like &1Manasteel Tools&0, but when swung, there's a chance for it to create a beam that will deal as much damage as a melee hit.
botania.page.terraSword1=No Broken Hero Sword

# -- TERRA SHATTERER
botania.entry.terraPick=Terra Shatterer
botania.tagline.terraPick=Upgradable pickaxe with large area of effect powers
botania.page.terraPick0=The &1Terra Shatterer&0 is a tool that can amass insane quantities of mana on itself, due to the amount of &1Terrasteel&0 required for its creation.<br>The tool functions very much like a &1Mana Tablet&0, in that it can amass &4Mana&0 by being tossed on a &1Mana Pool&0. It can't give the &4Mana&0 back, though, so it doesn't function as a storage method.
botania.page.terraPick1=The amount of &4Mana&0 stored on the tool defines its &4Rank&0. Ranks go as follows: &4D&0, &4C&0, &4B&0, &4A&0, &4S&0, &4SS&0, with &4D&0 being the default rank.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required to advance from rank to rank increases as the rank does. To advance from &4D&0 to &4C&0, for example, it requires just a few seconds of exposition to a &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.terraPick2=To advance from rank &4C&0 to rank &4B&0, a full &1Mana Pool&0 is required, and the cost increases by a tenfold per rank from there on in, all the way to &4SS&0.<br>The rank of the tool does not change its speed, but instead, it increases the power of its &4Active Ability&0.<br>Toggling the tool's ability can be done via right click.
botania.page.terraPick3=While the tool is active, it enables it to break blocks in an extended area. At rank &4C&0 it's a small column, which increases to a square at rank &4B&0, that gets larger through the ranks. It's to note that the rank &4D&0 tool does not have the active ability.<br>Having the tool active consumes &4Mana&0 from its storage passively, even if not being used to mine.
botania.page.terraPick4=Lastly, the tool takes damage for every single block broken, so a good supply of &4Mana&0 in the wielder's inventory is a must for the higher ranks, as the tool does function like normal &1Manasteel Tools&0, in that it'll use &4Mana&0 instead of actually taking damage, given it's made of &1Terrasteel&0.<br>It also won't despawn like regular dropped items.
botania.page.terraPick5=WE'RE MINING IN THE DATABASE WOW WOW

# -- ROD OF THE SEAS
botania.entry.waterRod=Rod of the Seas
botania.tagline.waterRod=A rod to create water
botania.page.waterRod0=Similarly to its land counterpart, the &1Rod of the Seas&0 will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0, place down a &1Water&0 block wherever it's used on. Furthermore, it can also be used to refill a &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.waterRod1=Keep the Earth clean, it isn't Uranus

# -- ELEMENTIUM EQUIPMENT
botania.entry.elfGear=Elementium Equipment
botania.tagline.elfGear=Manasteel equivalent gear with special properties
botania.page.elfGear0=Similarly to other metals, as expected, &1Elementium&0 can, too, be shaped into tools and armor.<br>These pieces of equipment have a decent resistance to damage, about half of that of diamond, as well as the ability to drain &4Mana&0 to prevent damage.
botania.page.elfGear1=Each of the tools come with their own ability or power of sorts which makes them unique. The armor allows the wearer to, when hit, have a chance to spawn a &1Pixie&0 that goes after the attacker, dealing decent damage.<br>The more pieces of &1Elementium Armor&0 equipped, the higher the chance.
botania.page.elfGear2=Starting off, the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 will destroy any &1Cobblestone&0, &1Dirt&0, &1Netherrack&0 and other mundane materials, leaving behind only the ores and fine resources.<br>Combining the &1Elementium Pickaxe&0 with a &1Terra Shatterer&0 in a crafting square allows for the latter to also get this power. This can't be undone.
botania.page.elfGear3=I can fit a shower in my pocket, screw cobble
botania.page.elfGear4=The &1Elementium Shovel&0 will, case the block dug is affected by gravity (&1Gravel&0, &1Sand&0, etc), dig all the blocks of that material above and/or below it, no more gravel falling while mining.
botania.page.elfGear5=Putting Things on Top of Other Things
botania.page.elfGear6=The &1Elementium Axe&0 doubles as a weapon, if used to strike the finishing blow to a &4Zombie&0, &4Skeleton&0, &4Creeper&0 or even another &4Player&0, it has a chance to decapitate them, leaving their severed head or skull behind.  
botania.page.elfGear7=Off with their heads
botania.page.elfGear8=The &1Elementium Shears&0 hold the ability to, when held back like a bow, shear any nearby sheep with speed within a large area of effect centered on the holder.
botania.page.elfGear9=Nui? She's h-arm-less
botania.page.elfGear10=Lastly, the &1Elementium Sword&0 will increase the chance of a &4Pixie&0 spawning when hit (this holds true when no &1Elementium Armor&0 is worn) and increases the strength of any &4Pixies&0 spawned.
botania.page.elfGear11=The Lambent Light
botania.page.elfGear12=Fortuna on the Sixteenth Night

# -- ROD OF THE BIFROST
botania.entry.rainbowRod=Rod of the Bifrost
botania.tagline.rainbowRod=A rod to create rainbow bridges, and fancy building blocks
botania.page.rainbowRod0=&4Bifrost&0, the rainbow bridge that reaches between the world and the realm of the gods.<br>While this item, the &1Rod of the Bifrost&0 doesn't exactly do that, it allows the holder, via a right click and at the cost of some &4Mana&0, to create a rainbow bridge in the direction he or she is looking at.
botania.page.rainbowRod1=This bridge extends as far as a hundred blocks, and will vanish after about fifteen seconds.<br>Only one bridge can be created for any given &1Rod of the Bifrost&0 at a time, as soon as the old bridge vanishes, a new one can be created.
botania.page.rainbowRod6=This rod can be given to a &1Livingwood Avatar&0. When done so, it'll create a rainbow bridge in front of wherever it's looking, whenever a player tries to walk in that area.<br>This process uses &4Mana&0 from the avatar, and can be disabled by applying redstone to it.

# -- ROD OF THE SKIES
botania.entry.tornadoRod=Rod of the Skies
botania.tagline.tornadoRod=A rod to jump high in the sky
botania.page.tornadoRod0=The &1Rod of the Skies&0 is a magical instrument with the ability to propel one in the air at fast velocity for the cost of some &4Mana&0.<br>To do so, one would simply hold it like a bow and watch as their momentum increases.<br>The rod takes a small amount of time to recharge, but during that time it'll block any fall damage, keeping the user safe.
botania.page.tornadoRod2=This rod can be given to a &1Livingwood Avatar&0. When done so, any players near the avatar will be launched high in the air, as if they'd used the rod, whenever they jump.<br>This process uses &4Mana&0 from the avatar, and can be disabled by applying redstone it.

# -- ROD OF THE HELLS
botania.entry.fireRod=Rod of the Hells
botania.tagline.fireRod=A rod to create circles of flame
botania.page.fireRod0=The &1Rod of the Hells&0 contains the essence of a burning flame, using it on the ground will create a circle of fire that burns anything inside it, for a decent cost of &4Mana&0.<br>The ring has a decent radius, and takes a small amount of time to fully propagate, it's to note that after that time it burns anything living in it, the caster included.
botania.page.fireRod2=This rod can be given to a &1Livingwood Avatar&0. When done so, it'll create a similar ring of flame that the rod creates when used.<br>This process uses &4Mana&0 from the avatar, and can be disabled by applying redstone to it.

botania.tagline.vineBall=Throwable vines you can climb like ladders
botania.page.vineBall0=&1Ladders&0 can't stand up on their own, they require something on their back, whereas &1Vines&0 don't. Normally, though, &1Vines&0 aren't strong enough for someone to climb them when they're freestanding.<br>By combining a few &1Vines&0, it's possible to create a ball that can be thrown, to create a climbable ladder of strong &1Vines&0 where it hits.
botania.page.vineBall1=It's also possible, by combining some materials such as &1Livingwood&0 or a &1Rune of Air&0 to create a slingshot that lets these &1Vine Balls&0 be shot while completely ignoring the force of gravity.
botania.page.vineBall2=This would be in Vineacraft...

botania.tagline.laputaShard=Raise parts of your world as floating islands
botania.page.laputaShard0=Via a somewhat complex magic activation sequence, combining a few interesting resources, including &1Gaia Spirits&0 would allow one to create a shard that, when used on the ground, will lift an almost spherical area around that point up into the air.<br>This process consumes the shard and can take upwards of ten minutes depending on the mass of land.
botania.page.laputaShard2=The radius of the island creates start at 14 blocks, on other words, 28 blocks of diameter. It's possible to increase the size by upgrading the shard with additional &1Gaia Spirits&0, each one adds 1 block to the radius, or 2 to the diameter.

botania.page.diviningRod0=The &1Rod of the Plentiful Mantle&0 has the ability to divine in a decently large radius around the user to find any ores. These will shine for a little bit, allowing their location.<br>This process, obviously, requires a decent amount of &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.
botania.page.diviningRod2=This rod can be given to a &1Livingwood Avatar&0. When done so, it'll show all nearby ores, as if it was used by a player.

botania.page.regenIvy1=To apply it, one'd simply craft the tool in question alongside the ivy and 3 of an item that can be used to repair the tool in an anvil (eg. &1Diamonds&0 for a &1Diamond Pickaxe&0).<br>Due to not being in direct contact with the material, the amount of &4Mana&0 used by the ivy in comparison to &1Manasteel&0 is rather high.

Having the item in hand displays a "halo" of recipes around the holder.<br>First off, right clicking on the &1Crafting Table&0 will open up a crafting interface.
botania.page.craftingHalo1=As long as the item is present in the inventory the last crafting recipe done will be stored in it.<br>Right clicking an empty slot of the halo will set the last recipe on it.

# -- LENS CLIP
botania.entry.clip=Lens Clip
botania.tagline.clip=A Mana Blaster upgrade that lets it have multiple lenses
botania.page.clip0=While a formidable and versatile tool, the &1Mana Blaster&0's greatest downfall is the lack of an ability to store more than one &1Lens&0 at once. Not any more. The &1Lens Clip&0 will attach to a &1Mana Blaster&0 in a crafting grid and allow it to store up to 6 lenses rather than just one.<br>As they say, Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun...
botania.page.clip1=Adding and removing &1Lenses&0 works just as it did previously, with one detail. The lens will be added or removed in the slot that the clip is currently on.<br>To change this slot, simply shift-right click the &1Mana Blaster&0 in the air.

botania.page.overgrowthSeed0=An &1Overgrowth Seed&0 is an elusive item, which can be used to enchant a piece of &1Grass&0, via right clicking on it in the world, creating &1Enchanted Soil&0. Flowers that are rooted on this &1Enchanted Soil&0 will function at double the normal speed.<br>&4Passive flowers&0 planted on this soil won't get the speed boost, instead, they will simply not decay.
botania.page.overgrowthSeed1=There's one problem, though.<br>No known method of creating these exists. They have however, been allegedly spotted by historians in ancient structures and temples. Perhaps that would be a wise guess as to where to find these.

# -- LIVINGWOOD BOW
botania.entry.livingwoodBow=Livingwood Bow
botania.tagline.livingwoodBow=A stronger bow that regenerates using Mana
botania.page.livingwoodBow0=The &1Livingwood Bow&0 is, as the name describes, a bow made of &1Livingwood&0 strung with &1Mana Infused String&0. Due to its components, it will last for longer than a normal &1Bow&0. It'll also repair itself using &4Mana&0, similarly to &1Manasteel Tools&0.
botania.page.livingwoodBow1=Does it shoot airplanes?

# -- CRYSTAL BOW
botania.entry.crystalBow=Crystal Bow
botania.tagline.crystalBow=A faster bow that creates arrows from Mana
botania.page.crystalBow0=Crafted with &1Dragonstone&0, the &1Crystal Bow&0 is a ranged weapon with the capacity to generate arrows from &4Mana&0. Similarly to the &1Livingwood Bow&0, it'll repair using &4Mana&0 as well, but carrying &1Arrows&0 is not required as they are created through the magical energies.<br>Given the lightweight and flexible structure of the bow, it can also fire at a much increased velocity than a conventional wooden one.

# -- STONE OF TEMPERANCE
botania.entry.temperanceStone=Stone of Temperance
botania.tagline.temperanceStone=A limiter for the power of a Terra Shatterer
botania.page.temperanceStone0=The &1Terra Shatterer&0 is able to destroy huge tracts of land when charged to its maximum potential, however, this might not always be the user's intent. A small, 3x3 tunnel might be more fitting in some cases. Having an active &1Stone of Temperance&0 in one's inventory will prevent their shatterer from breaking any more than a 3x3 area. This also affects the &1Terra Truncator&0. The stone can be toggled on and off by shift-right clicking.
botania.page.temperanceStone1=Don't lose it

# -- TERRA TRUNCATOR
botania.entry.terraAxe=Terra Truncator
botania.tagline.terraAxe=An axe that chops down whole trees. How inspired
botania.page.terraAxe0=The &1Terra Truncator&0 is a greataxe of premium quality achievable only with &1Terrasteel&0. When hitting a tree it'll take the whole thing down with speed, bringing all the logs and leaves along with it. Of course, this comes at a hefty cost of &4Mana&0.<br>This effect doesn't happen while sneaking or if the user has a &1Stone of Temperance&0.

botania.entry.slimeBottle=Slime in a Bottle
botania.tagline.slimeBottle=Slime chunk detector
botania.page.slimeBottle0=Placing some slime in an &1Elementium Container&0 seems to have an interesting effect on said slime. When in an area where &1Slimes&0 would naturally spawn underground, the inanimate blob of slime starts jumping for some odd reason.<br>This can definitely prove useful for harvesting slimeballs or setting up a &1Narslimmus&0 however.

# -- ROD OF THE SHIFTING CRUST
botania.entry.exchangeRod=Rod of the Shifting Crust
botania.tagline.exchangeRod=A rod to change blocks
botania.page.exchangeRod0=&1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0 is a magical device with the ability to swap blocks in the world at very fast speeds. In order to achieve this, one must first select a block to swap with, this is done by shift-right clicking that block in the world.<br>After this block is selected, left clicking any other block in the world will swap it for that block, assuming it's present in the user's inventory.
botania.page.exchangeRod1=Right clicking on a block in the world will start a larger transformation, which will swap all highlighted blocks into the one selected. Obviously, these blocks do come from the user's inventory as well. Only proper, full size blocks can be used for this swap, so no flowers, torches or other shenenigans of the sort. Using this power does, naturally, require &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory.
botania.page.exchangeRod2=Other rods or devices can be used to extend the power of the &1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0.<br>For example, having a &1Rod of the Lands&0 in one's inventory provides the &1Rod of the Shifting Crust&0 with an endless supply of &1Dirt&0, assuming the &4Mana&0 cost for the &1Rod of the Lands&0' dirt conjuration is fulfilled.

botania.page.manaweave0=&1Manaweave Cloth&0 is a type of fabric with powerful ties to the primal energies contained in &4Mana&0.<br>Armor can be made of this cloth, &1Manaweave Robes&0, while they aren't very strong when it comes to raw resistance and strength, the robes make up for it with a powerful set bonus, making tools and rods cheaper to use, &4Mana&0 wise, and making the latter more powerful. 
botania.page.manaweave1=Wearing the full set of &1Manaweave Robes&0 grants the wearer with increased proficiency when operating magical rods, increasing the power/range of them, or just their cost, for some of the more simpleton ones.<br>&1Manaweave Robes&0 can use &4Mana&0 from one's inventory to repair themselves, similarly to &1Manasteel Armor&0, but, due to their affinities with the primal energies, at a lower mana cost.

botania.page.sextant0=In this cubic world, the art of creating circles often eludes many, to the point where they have to perform the unholy art of "tabbing out" in order to learn the procedures for creating one.<br>The &1Worldshaper's Sextant&0 is a simple tool to, you guessed it, aid in creating circles. To use the item, simply point at a block to set a center and look around to expand the radius.
botania.page.sextant1=While the item is being used, a blue circle will appear in the world, as a simple preview of where the circle will be placed. Upon letting go, a circle of fake &1Cobblestone&0 blocks will show up as your building guide.<br>Shift-right clicking with this item in hand resets or removes the circle.

botania.page.enderAir0=The air present in the void of the &1End&0 seems to have some mutating properties. Right clicking with an empty &1Glass Bottle&0 while in the &1End&0 will capture some of that air, which can then later be tossed similarly to a splash potion, turning nearby &1Stone&0 on the landing point into &1End Stone&0.

botania.page.pistonRelay1=To break the block, shift-right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, any other means will destroy it.<br>Furthermore, this block is highly unstable, and may create uncanny effects, care is to be taken. It is also resistant to glue, both in pulling and pushing. This allows for a "frame" like setup.

I swear, the person who came up with them must have taken a &onotch&r too much of their drink.<br>However, by infusing a standard dagger with some of their energy, one can create the &1Soulscribe&0, a dagger that tears through &1Endermen&0 as if they were butter.
botania.page.enderDagger1=Due of the type of infusion, though, the dagger only lasts for a few kills, and the energy that radiates from it prevents the &1Manasteel&0 from gathering &4Mana&0 to avoid damage, like typical tools would. Still, all in the name of killing those monsters.

botania.page.spawnerClaw0=&1Monster Spawners&0 are an interesting bunch. They have the ability to bring out life from thin air, but somehow, this only manifests when there's a player nearby.<br>This, of course, tends to be a rather limiting factor in the onslaught of any creatures that they can create.
botania.page.spawnerClaw1=By placing a &1Life Imbuer&0 on top of a &1Monster Spawner&0 and giving it a rather decent chunk of &4Mana&0 through a &1Mana Spreader&0, when there aren't any players in the nearby vicinity, the &4Mana&0 will power the spawner, just as if there were players around.

# -- RED STRING
botania.entry.redString=Red String
botania.tagline.redString=Remote inventories and other remote things
botania.page.redString0=Lore says the Gods tie a red string around the ankles of people who are supposed to affect each others lives. This led inventors to come up with a way of connecting blocks over the air, called, of course, &1Red String&0. Blocks created with this exquisite material can face in all 6 basic directions and bind to the first available and compatible block they can find, given a range.
botania.page.redString1=Each &4Red Stringed&0 block has a different criteria to what it'll bind to, but the distance in which they'll bind stays constant between the variations. The string can be viewed, if a block is bound, by holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>Blocks being in the way will not break the connection. Lastly, &1Red String&0 blocks can't be chained.
botania.page.redString2=Are you in a pinch?
botania.page.redString3=Starting off, the &1Red Stringed Container&0 will bind to any inventory (&1Chests&0, &1Furnaces&0, &1Hoppers&0, etc), items can be put into it using &1Hoppers&0 or any other means of insertion. The items will end up in the block it's bound to, and will enter from the same side as they were put on the &1Red Stringed Container&0 itself.
botania.page.redString4=The &1Red Stringed Container&0.
botania.page.redString5=The &1Red Stringed Dispenser&0 can be bound to &1Dispensers&0 or &1Droppers&0, it functions similarly to the &1Red Stringed Container&0 where items can also be placed in the bound block through it. When a redstone signal is given to it, the &1Dispenser&0 or &1Dropper&0 in the end will fire.
botania.page.redString6=The &1Red Stringed Dispenser&0.
botania.page.redString7=The &1Red Stringed Nutrifier&0 can be bound to any block that can be fertilized with &1Bone Meal&0. Using &1Bone Meal&0 on the block will fertilize the bound block instead.
botania.page.redString8=The &1Red Stringed Nutrifier&0.
botania.page.redString9=The &1Red Stringed Comparator&0 can be bound to any block whose status can be read with a &1Container&0, such as &1Chests&0, &1Mana Pools&0, &1Runic Altars&0, etc. Placing a &1Comparator&0 pointing outwards of this block will send the signal equal to the signal a &1Comparator&0 would send on the bound block.
botania.page.redString10=The &1Red Stringed Comparator&0.
botania.page.redString11=The &1Red Stringed Spoofer&0 is an interesting one. Any flower with an effect can be placed on it. The block will bind to any flowers or mushrooms. While there's a flower on top of the block, that flower will not do anything, but the bound block will take all of that flower's properties and work as if it was the flower itself.
botania.page.redString12=The &1Red Stringed Spoofer&0.
botania.page.redString13=Lastly, the &1Red Stringed Interceptor&0 will bind to any complex block (such as a &1Chest&0, &1Furnace&0, &1Petal Apothecary&0, etc). Whenever the block its bound to is right clicked by a player, the interceptor will emit a redstone pulse.
botania.page.redString14=The &1Red Stringed Interceptor&0.

# -- FLUGEL TIARA
botania.entry.flightTiara=Flügel Tiara
botania.tagline.flightTiara=The ability to fly... for a bit
botania.page.flightTiara0=The &4Flügel&0 were once a dominant species in the lands, now they're but a race past extinct, once created as godslayers, who possessed the ability of flight.<br>The usage of &1Gaia Spirits&0 allows for a small replica of their power, in the form of the &1Flügel Tiara&0, which, at the cost of &4Mana&0 allows for flight.
botania.page.flightTiara4=Not all is perfect with reproducing old technology though, the tiara has its flaws, that meaning it can't provide the power of flight constantly. If used for over thirty seconds without letting it recharge it'll stop being able to provide the power of flight.<br>A "flight bar" is displayed on the HUD to help monitor this.
botania.page.flightTiara5=In addition to simple flight, the tiara grants the wearer the ability to &4dash&0 and &4glide&0. Pressing the sprint key (CTRL by default) while flying, provided one isn't sprinting already, will start a dash, a quick speed boost in the direction the wearer's facing.<br>Dashes can only be done every 2 seconds.
botania.page.flightTiara6=Gliding allows one to gently descend to the ground while also covering a decent horizontal distance. It also prevents fall damage. To glide, one would simply sneak while falling.<br>Gliding can be executed even with an empty flight bar, but while gliding, the flight bar regenerates slower than normally.
botania.page.flightTiara1=Forty thousand books from another world
botania.page.flightTiara2=Combining the Tiara with a variety of Quartz species allows for it to create various different kinds of aesthetic wings, one for each style of quartz.<br>The recipes for the various types of quartz can be found in the &4Decorative Blocks&0 entry under &4Miscellaneous&0, &1Elven Quartz&0 is acquired by trading &1Nether Quartz&0 with the elves.

# -- BASICS OF CORPOREA
botania.entry.corporea=Basics of Corporea
botania.tagline.corporea=A system to manage inventories
botania.page.corporea0=&4Corporea&0 is a magical system that utilizes the energy of the end and the empty space in the world to transport items from point A to point B instantly and without any connecting parts.<br>The system works through a variant of &1Sparks&0, &1Corporea Sparks&0. These share some similarities with normal &1Sparks&0 but also a fair few differences.
botania.page.corporea1=Starting off, they can go on top of any &4Inventory&0, like a &1Chest&0 or a &1Dispenser&0 as opposed to &4Mana Containers&0, secondly, there's two types of &1Corporea Sparks&0, the basic &1Corporea Spark&0 and the &1Master Corporea Spark&0. These sparks work in a network-like system, each &1Master Corporea Spark&0 designates a &4Corporea Network&0, in which any spark can communicate with other sparks present in it.
botania.page.corporea2=When a &1Corporea Spark&0 is placed or polled, each spark will poll any nearby sparks, adding them to the network designated by the single &1Master Corporea Spark&0 and also polling other nearby sparks, in a chain. While each individual spark can only reach a few blocks, combined, the entire network can go for a virtually infinite distance.
botania.page.corporea3=&1Corporea Sparks&0 have a view of the inventory directly below them, but can only access items from the top side. Each &1Corporea Spark&0 has the ability to view every other spark in the network and its contents, and the ability to request them as necessary, depending on the type of block below it.
botania.page.corporea4=It's to note that the &1Master Corporea Spark&0, while being part of the network, can not have the items in its inventory extracted from.<br>Futhermore, no requests for items in the network are ever done passively. Corporea does not have the ability to add new items to the network, those should be inserted physically through &1Hoppers&0 or other methods.
botania.page.corporea5=Similarly to normal &1Sparks&0, &1Corporea Sparks&0 have a method of augmentation, that being the ability to color them. While in the world, there's an icon floating around the spark that shows which color it has, this can be changed by right clicking on the spark with a piece of &1Floral Powder&0. These colors define networks. A spark may only be in the same network as another spark if the two have the same color. 
botania.page.corporea6=The ability to color sparks allows for multiple different &4Corporea Networks&0 to be together in a close area, without interfering with each other.<br>Viewing the network and removing the spark works exactly the same as a normal spark. Lastly, having two &1Master Corporea Sparks&0 of the same color nearby, while possible, is a bad idea and will cause conflicts and odd behaviour.
botania.page.corporea7=A spark of ingenuity
botania.page.corporea8=Love-coloured

# -- CORPOREA INDEX
botania.entry.corporeaIndex=Corporea Index
botania.tagline.corporeaIndex=Request items from a Corporea network via chat
botania.page.corporeaIndex0=The biggest ability of a &4Corporea Network&0 is the ability to vocally request items from it by name. The &1Corporea Index&0 is an ender-crystal like block that can interface with a given &4Corporea Network&0 by having a &1Corporea Spark&0 placed on top of it.<br>While in the world, approaching it will cause it to activate and show the radius in which it will stay activated.
botania.page.corporeaIndex1=While activated, the index will intercept any &4Chat Messages&0 sent by nearby players, taking them in as &4requests&0 and preventing them to be broadcasted to chat. From this, it'll request, from the network, items whose name matches the request. For example, writing "iron ingot" will have the index look through the network for a single &1Iron Ingot&0 and transport it towards itself, materializing it in the world.
botania.page.corporeaIndex2=Requests can be more complex than just a single item. For example "10 apples" will request, as described, 10 &1Apples&0. Writing "this" will search for items whose name equals the name of the item in the player's hand. Prepending or appending to a query "...", "~", "+" or "?" will turn it into a "contains" rather than "equals" query. So writing "iron..." will find all items that have "iron" in their name, for example.
botania.page.corporeaIndex3=The plural form of an item's name may only be used case it's a regular noun when it comes to the plural (suffixed by "-s", "-es" or "-ies"), the singular version works just as well for requests of multiple items, such as "10 apple".<br>"10 of this" requests 10 items whose name equals the item in the player's hand, as expected.
botania.page.corporeaIndex4=Examples of complex requests include "10 apples", "a stack of apples", "2 stacks of apples", "2 stacks and 20 apples", "half a stack of apples", "a dozen apples", and so on.<br>The index will also recognise more or less verbose forms of request, so "2x stacks and 20x of apples" is equal to "2 stack 2 apple" or "2 stacks + 2 apples".
botania.page.corporeaIndex5=Requesting with "all" or "every" will deliver every single item in the network that matches the criteria, so "all apples" will deliver all the apples in the network.<br>On the other side, requesting "count", "show", "display" or "tell" won't request any, but will tell the requester how many exist in the network.
botania.page.corporeaIndex8=While near a &1Corporea Index&0, if one is using &4NotEnoughItems&0, pressing C on an item in one's inventory (or NEI panel) will request 1 of said item.<br>Using SHIFT will instead request a full stack, CTRL will request half a stack and SHIFT+CTRL a quarter of a stack.
botania.page.corporeaIndex6=Lastly, while near a &1Corporea Index&0, writing part of an item's name and pressing TAB in the chat menu will autocomplete the item's name.
botania.page.corporeaIndex7=A certain magical one at that

# -- CORPOREA FUNNEL
botania.entry.corporeaFunnel=Corporea Funnel
botania.tagline.corporeaFunnel=Request items from a Corporea network via redstone
botania.page.corporeaFunnel0=A simpler block that utilizes the prospects of the &4Corporea Network&0 is the &1Corporea Funnel&0, when given access to a network through a &1Corporea Spark&0 on top, it'll pull a single item from the network when given a redstone signal.<br>This item is put into an inventory 1 or 2 blocks below it, or case one doesn't exist or is full, tossed into the world right above the funnel.
botania.page.corporeaFunnel1=The &1Corporea Funnel&0 may only pull items that match its filter, similarly to a &1Hopperhock&0, the filter is designated by items contained on &1Item Frames&0 placed on it. The item pulled is one of the various items in the frames at random.<br>Rotating the item changes how many will be requested at once, starting at 1, rotating will pull 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, and finally 64 items, respectively.
botania.page.corporeaFunnel2=Energistically applied

# -- CORPOREA INTERCEPTOR
botania.entry.corporeaInterceptor=Corporea Interceptor
botania.tagline.corporeaInterceptor=Intercept Corporea requests and send redstone signals
botania.page.corporeaInterceptor0=The &1Corporea Interceptor&0 does exactly as the name suggests, it intercepts corporea requests. First and foremost, &1Item Frames&0 with items need be attached around the block, these define what items will trigger the interceptor.<br>Whenever a request is fired to the corporea network, be it from an Index, Funnel, etc, and there's no items in the network that can fulfil it this block will be triggered.
botania.page.corporeaInterceptor1=Of course, the the block is only triggered if the item requested matches one of items in the &1Item Frames&0 about it. When the block is triggered it'll emit a short redstone pulse. This can be used to do all sorts of things, such as craft the required item using &1Crafty Crates&0 or light up a lamp indicating that the inventory for a resource is out.
botania.page.corporeaInterceptor2=So many automation prospects

# -- CORPOREA CRYSTAL CUBE
botania.entry.corporeaCrystalCube=Corporea Crystal Cube
botania.tagline.corporeaCrystalCube=View and request items from a Corporea network
botania.page.corporeaCrystalCube0=A seer usually looks through a crystal ball to see the future. Well, a corporea handler would look through a crystal cube to see the present. The &1Corporea Crystal Cube&0 acts as a visual medium to interact ith one's &4Corporea Network&0. Placing the block down and giving it a &1Corporea Spark&0 is the obvious first step to hooking it up to the network. 
botania.page.corporeaCrystalCube1=When the block is connected, right clicking it with any sort of item will have it monitor that item, allowing someone who's looking at it see how many exist in the network. The display updates about once every second.<br>While there's an item selected, left clicking the block will request one of that item from the network. Shift-left clicking requests a whole stack.
botania.page.corporeaCrystalCube3=The &1Corporea Crystal Cube&0 can be used alongside a &1Redstone Comparator&0. This will output the amount of items of the type it's looking for in the system. The output value follows a logarithmic progression, or on layman's terms, every level requires twice as many of the item as the previous one, starting at 1. 0 items would be signal 0. 1 item for 1, 2 items for 2, 4 items for 3, 8 items for 4, 16 items for 5 and so on up to 15.
botania.page.corporeaCrystalCube2=I can see forever

# -- CORPOREA RETAINER
botania.entry.corporeaRetainer=Corporea Retainer
botania.tagline.corporeaRetainer=Memory for re-doing Corporea requests
botania.page.corporeaRetainer0=The &1Corporea Retainer&0 is an addon of sorts to the &1Corporea Interceptor&0. Placing one of these adjacent to an interceptor allows for the interceptor to pass along to it the original corporea request, if it's intercepted.<br>When this happens, the retainer remembers which corporea object in the network initiated the request as well as the contents of said request.
botania.page.corporeaRetainer1=Once the &1Corporea Retainer&0 receives a redstone signal after it's been informed of a request, it'll have the original requestor redo the exact same request. For example, a funnel might request &1Wooden Planks&0 from the network. An interceptor intercepts the request and passes a signal along to craft the planks. The retainer then gets a signal, allowing for the original funnel to redo the request and get its planks.
botania.page.corporeaRetainer2=As the &1Corporea Retainer&0 acts as an addon to the interceptor, it can use it to interact with the network, thus not needing a spark itself.<br>The retainer can only hold on to one request at a time, and will not accept another until the last one is fulfilled. A &1Redstone Comparator&0 can read if there's a request to be done or not.

botania.tagline.keepIvy=Ivy that can be attached to items to keep them after death
botania.page.keepIvy0=Everyone knows that before being ressurected, one's items splatter all over the ground, generally a massive nuisance. The fix for this is rather simple. By attaching a piece of &1Resolute Ivy&0 to an item through a crafting grid, that item will presist on one's inventory through death. The ivy will degenerate after that fact and will need to be applied again if one wishes to have the item survive another downfall.
botania.page.keepIvy2=There is, however, one restriction to the items in which this ivy can be attached to.<br>For &otechnical reasons&r, the ivy may not be attached to any item that, upon being used in a crafting table, gives something in return, such as &1Buckets of Water&0 or the &1Mortar and Pestle&0.

botania.page.luminizerTransport1=&1Luminizers&0 have a range of twenty blocks each, but can be chained to create longer and more complex paths.<br>The connection between two &1Luminizers&0 goes only one way, unless the binding is explicitly done both ways.

botania.page.luminizerTransport2=Luminize to the future
botania.page.luminizerTransport3=Adding some redstone to a &1Luminizer&0 creates a &1Detector Luminizer&0. For all intents and purposes, it functions just like a regular &1Luminizer&0, however, it sends out a &4redstone pulse&0 every time something passes through it or reaches it as an endpoint.
botania.page.luminizerTransport4=Are you ready to draw?
botania.page.luminizerTransport5=While players can just right click the &1Luminizers&0, in order to get animals, dropped items, or other beings into the trails, a &1Luminizer Launcher&0 is required. This block needs to be placed down adjacent to &1Luminizers&0, and when it receives a &4redstone pulse&0, it'll randomly distribute all living beings and dropped items on top of it into all of the adjacent &1Luminizers&0, causing them to go on their merry way.

More important, perhaps, is that when someone wearing this monocle looks at a flower they'll be able to see its functional radius.
botania.page.monocle2=As an added bonus, looking at redstone pieces with the &1Manaseer Monocle&0 worn will show info about them, expediting the process of creating redstonic contraptions.<br>The monocle can be used as a &4Cosmetic Override&0 to any other bauble.

If it runs out of &4Mana&0, the connection will be broken.
botania.page.aIntro6=The amount of &4Mana&0 required to open up the portal is orders of magnitude higher than that to keep it maintained, thus closing the portal to prevent &4Mana&0 loss is a poor strategy.<br>Furthermore, the link isn't strong enough to allow living beings to go through it, but it seems that &4items&0 can.
botania.page.aIntro7=The amount of information about &1Alfheim&0 stored in this lexicon is limited to this entry alone. Perhaps &4letting the&0 &4Elves have a look at it&0 might prove beneficial.<br>Perhaps they'd also return a good amount of knowledge of their mystical constructs.

We thank you very much for providing us with a repository of the knowledge from your world, as to keep us up to date to what happened since we left it, it's been a while since then, it's good to see it's doing well.
botania.page.elfMessage2=&oAfter some discussion with the high council of Elven Garde, we have decided to cooperate with you. You see, reading through your "Lexica Botania" has shown us a good amount of resources from your world that we would be extremely keen as to get our hands on, as these are non-existent in our lands.
botania.page.elfMessage3=&oThe link you have managed to establish is rather weak, no living beings will be able to go through, as you already know. However, there's a positive side to this, the link strikes the fabric of time of both our worlds in a way where it doesn't keep them in sync, that's the reason why you received your book back so quickly.
botania.page.elfMessage4=&oWhen it comes to Mana and other magical energies, we are plenty stocked on them, so worry not about the portal closing on our end. Let's put this in prospect, in order for the advance of both our civilizations, we vow to accept a given set of resources from your world we lack in ours in exchange for resources you lack in yours.
botania.page.elfMessage5=&oWe have taken the liberty of assigning our best scribes to put together a great set of knowledge from our world we're willing to share, you can find it in your lexicon just as you'd find knowledge from yours. We hope you find it enlightening and that it encourages you to invest in our materials.
botania.page.elfMessage6=&oLast but not least, do keep in mind that if you decide to send something we have not vouched to trade for, we will assume it as a gift and keep it for ourselves, just as a forewarning. We look forward to exchanging resources with you.<br>Best Regards, the High Council of Elven Garde.

# -- RITUAL OF GAIA
botania.entry.gaiaRitual=Ritual of Gaia
botania.tagline.gaiaRitual=Summon the Guardian of Gaia for GREAT JUSTICE!
botania.page.gaiaRitual0=The &4Ritual of Gaia&0 is a procedure often enacted by the elves, which is the only way to acquire &1Gaia Spirits&0, which are essences of the power of the Goddess of Gaia herself.<br>This ritual required an &4Active&0 &1Beacon&0 with some &1Gaia Pylons&0 (read on) one level above the beacon as the altar, as well as a single &1Terrasteel Ingot&0 as a sacrifice.
botania.page.gaiaRitual1=Creating &1Gaia Pylons&0
botania.page.gaiaRitual2=Ritual of Gaia
botania.page.gaiaRitual3=To start the ritual, simply shift-right click the &1Beacon&0 block with a &1Terrasteel Ingot&0, take a step back and prepare to fight for your life. Good preparation is required, as the fight with the &4Guardian of Gaia&0 can be even harder than that of the &4Wither&0. Upon defeating the &4Guardian&0, one can collect their prize, a handful of &1Spirits of Gaia&0.
botania.page.gaiaRitual4=The common attire for this ritual is a set of Enchanted &1Elementium Armor&0, a &1Terra Blade&0 and a large assortment of &4Brews&0 and &4Baubles&0. The effect of the &1Beacon&0 is nullified during the battle, so that should be taken in mind.<br>The &1Guardian&0 has a massive health pool, so preparation in the form of &4Enchantments&0 and &4Brews&0 is a must!
botania.page.gaiaRitual5=The difficulty and rewards bestowed by the ritual depend on the amount of people participating. Executing the ritual with over five people might be a recipe for disaster due to the chaos created, so collaborative rituals of that scale shouldn't be attempted.<br>Lastly, staying away from the purple might be a good idea.

# -- RITUAL OF GAIA II
botania.entry.gaiaRitualHardmode=Ritual of Gaia II
botania.tagline.gaiaRitualHardmode=Pixie Boogaloo
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode0=One would think that combining two of the most powerful resources known to existance, in the form of &1Terrasteel&0 and &1Gaia Spirits&0 would create an unstoppable material. It seems that the material is very much stoppable, though. In fact, the two forces cancel eachother out when combined into an ingot, creating an utterly useless alloy.
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode1=This ingot, though, due to the concentrated energy and power in it, does allow for the summoning of a stronger &1Gaia Guardian&0, with more resistance, strength and speed.<br>For all of this, it also drops more &1Gaia Spirits&0 than normal, as well as a handful of goodies and rare treasure, making it a worthwhile foe.
botania.page.gaiaRitualHardmode2=Creating the &1Gaia Spirit Ingot&0.

# -- THE RELICS OF THE AESIR
botania.entry.relics=The Relics of the Aesir
botania.tagline.relics=A myth? Or reality?
botania.page.relics0=There's an old tale from the high clans of Alfheim. It says something among the lines of "The one who rolls the Dice of Fate is to be rewarded with the Gifts of the Gods". These so called &1Relics of the Aesir&0 are rumored to be unique and soulbound, by which only one will ever be awarded to any one individual and only they might use it.<br>But then again, it's probably just folklore.

# -- THE RELICS OF THE AESIR II
botania.entry.relicInfo=The Relics of the Aesir II
botania.tagline.relicInfo=They're real after all
botania.page.relicInfo0=It appears as if the speculated relics are, in fact, real. These items, materialized from rolls of the &1Dice of Fate&0 possess incredible powers, the fact that the dice is six-sided possibly indicates to the existance of six of these.<br>Relics seem to contain knowledge of who earned them, and thus giving someone else a relic that doesn't belong to them might be a poor idea.
botania.page.relicInfo1=According to the original texts, the same relic may not be awarded to any one person twice, so keeping the item safe is a priority. Perhaps something like &1Resolute Ivy&0 would be a good investment.<br>Interestingly enough, earning a relic also imparts upon this lexicon the knowledge on how to use it. How useful.

# -- THE FRUIT OF GRISAIA   
botania.entry.infiniteFruit=The Fruit of Grisaia
botania.tagline.infiniteFruit=Endless supply of nourishment
botania.page.infiniteFruit0=The relic known as &1The Fruit of Grisaia&0 is bestowed with the power to eternally nourish the brave soul who earned it. It can be eaten similarly to any other piece of food, but instead of utilizing matter to feed, it uses &4Mana&0 from one's inventory.<br>Hope you like the taste of apple though.

# -- KEY OF THE KING'S LAW
botania.entry.kingKey=Key of the King's Law
botania.tagline.kingKey=Open the treasury
botania.page.kingKey0=The &1Key of the King's Law&0 is a powerful relic with the ability to materialize weapons at command. Holding right click with this key will summon a plenthora of varied weapons from... somewhere. Up to twenty weapons can be created at once. Releasing the grip on the key will launch all the weapons, one at a time, where the summoner is looking at, at high speed. These weapons will create an explosion on contact.

# -- EYE OF THE FLUGEL
botania.entry.flugelEye=Eye of the Flügel
botania.tagline.flugelEye=The true power of a Flügel 
botania.page.flugelEye0=Unlike the fabricated &1Flügel Tiara&0, the &1Eye of the Flügel&0 contains primordial &4Flügel&0 magic. Magic strong enough, in fact, to harness the &4Flügels&0' ability to recall themselves to a place they've visited.<br>Shift-right clicking with this eye somewhere will bind it to that position. After that, holding right click for a while will recall the user back to the aforementioned location.
botania.page.flugelEye1=This teleportation ability not only costs &4Mana&0 but can not be executed across two different dimensions, sadly enough.<br>Aside from that, simply being in possession of an &1Eye of the Flügel&0 allows a wearer of the &1Flügel Tiara&0 to fly past the normal limits, at a higher cost, of course.

# -- RING OF THOR
botania.entry.thorRing=Ring of Thor
botania.tagline.thorRing=Because the Terra Shatterer wasn't strong enough
botania.page.thorRing0=One of the three mythic rings of the &4Aesir&0, the &1Ring of Thor&0, when worn, bestows upon the wearer the might of the Thunder God &4Thor&0. This power drastically increases the strength of area of effect mining with a &1Terra Shatterer&0.<br>This ring can be combined with the other two rings of the &4Aesir&0 in a crafting table to create the ultimate ring.

# -- RING OF LOKI
botania.entry.lokiRing=Ring of Loki
botania.tagline.lokiRing=The power to be here, and there, and over there too
botania.page.lokiRing0=One of the three mythic rings of the &4Aesir&0, the &1Ring of Loki&0 allows for the wearer to tap upon the Trickster God &4Loki&0 to effectively be in multiple places at once.<br>The setup for this ability requires, first and foremost, an empty hand. Shift-right clicking on a block with said empty hand while having the &1Ring of Loki&0 equipped begins the procedure.
botania.page.lokiRing1=Once the source block is selected, shift-right clicking on other blocks in the world will add them to the relative positions affected by this power. In order to finish the procedure, one would shift-right click the original block.<br>Shift-right clicking on one of the blocks that has been selected will remove it. To reset a completed selection, shift-right click the ground twice.
botania.page.lokiRing2=After the selection is complete, when looking around, one will notice multiple boxes in relative positions to the selected block. When a block is placed while sneaking, the placing action is mimicked on all of those positions, allowing for one to place a large amount of blocks at once. This ability also extends to destruction using the &1Terra Shatterer&0 or &1Terra Truncator&0.  
botania.page.lokiRing3=Such a power does not come for free of course. Utilizing this ability costs &4Mana&0 from the user's inventory per each block placed. It's to note that the more blocks that are selected, the more expensive &4each placed block&0 becomes.<br>Lastly, this ring can be combined with the other two rings of the &4Aesir&0 in a crafting table to create the ultimate ring.

# -- RING OF ODIN
botania.entry.odinRing=Ring of Odin
botania.tagline.odinRing=Godlike resistance
botania.page.odinRing0=One of the three mythic rings of the &4Aesir&0, the &1Ring of Odin&0 grants its wearer the vitality and resistance of the Elder God &4Odin&0. As well as the addition of ten extra hearts of health, the &1Ring of Odin&0 protects the wearer from various kinds of elemental damage such as drowning, suffocation, fire or starvation. The ring can also be combined with the other two rings of the &4Aesir&0 in a crafting table to create the ultimate ring. 

# -- ELVEN LORE - THE SHATTERING
botania.entry.elvenLore=Elven Lore - The Shattering
botania.tagline.elvenLore=Some lore on why we are where we are
botania.page.elvenLore0=It seems this section of the lexicon is just a bunch of pieces of paper. By the looks of them, they seem like they were taken from a document from the libraries of Elven Garde.<br>Their contents should contain historical knowledge, but doubtfully anything important to the studies of botany itself.
botania.page.elvenLore1=&oA few millennia have passed since The Shattering. The amount of us who actually know about what really happened that day is rather minute.

botania.page.elvenLore5=&oSpriggan also had fairly small scale consequences.

Right now our major concern is the status of Midgard. (...)
botania.page.elvenLore7=&oThe collapse of the Bifrost broke any interaction between the various worlds, but the sheer quantity of Mana residues we have left behind will surely have lingered and infused the world with life all over again, be it animal, floral or fungal, natural or magical in essence. We hope it's enough to create intelligent life that can properly harness it though.

botania.entry.unstableBlocks=Unstable Cubes
botania.tagline.unstableBlocks=Fancy accent blocks
botania.page.unstableBlocks0=Fiddling with highly powerful &4Mana&0 infused objects has lead to the creation of these strange cubes. They seem to emit some visual radiation in the form of colorful lightning, but it doesn't seem like it has any effects other than visual appeal.
botania.page.unstableBlocks1=They look fancy
botania.page.unstableBlocks2=And they come in all 16 colors
botania.page.unstableBlocks3=There's also a way of creating a different version of these that releases an extremely larger amount of energy, this time in the form of a beam towards the sky that extends into a cloud of sorts.

botania.page.challenges1=All of the challenges are possible, of course. They just require some thinking and knowledge of the ins and outs of redstone and the &1Botania&0 mechanics themselves.<br>It's highly recommended that they're done without using features from external mods, as they have been created with that in mind, and aren't really challenges if you put down a block that solves them instantly.
botania.page.challenges2=The challenges aren't obligatory in any way, and do not provide any material reward.
